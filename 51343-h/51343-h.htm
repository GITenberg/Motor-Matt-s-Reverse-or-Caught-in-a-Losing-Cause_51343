<p class="chaptitle">PLOTTERS THREE.</p>


<p>"There's no use talkin', Siwash," and Pecos Jones
leaned disgustedly back against the earth wall of the dugout;
"he's got one o' these here charmed lives, that feller
has, and it ain't no manner o' use tryin' to down him."</p>

<p>Siwash Charley was cramming tobacco into the bowl of
a black pipe. He halted operations long enough to give
his companion an angry look out from under his thick
brows.</p>

<p>"Oh, ye're the limit, Pecos!" he grunted, drawing a
match across the top of the table and trailing the flame
over the pipe bowl. "The cub's human, an' I ain't never
yet seen a human bein' that couldn't be downed&mdash;purvidin'
ye went about it right."</p>

<p>Pecos Jones scowled discontentedly.</p>

<p>"Then I opine," said he, "ye ain't got sense enough to
know how to go about it. That last attempt at Fort
Totten wasn't nothin' more'n a flash in the pan. What
did ye accomplish, huh? Tell me that. Here y' are, holed
up in this dugout an' not darin' to show yer face where
it'll be seen an' reckernized. The sojers want ye, an'
they want ye bad. Ye come purty nigh doin' up a leftenant
o' the army, an' that's why the milingtary is on yer
trail, but if they knowed as much o' yer hist'ry as I do,
they'd be arter ye a lot worse'n what they&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stow it!" roared Siwash Charley, leaning toward his
companion and bringing a fist down on the table with
force enough to make the flame leap upward in the chimney
of the tin lamp. "Ye'll hush arbout my past hist'ry,
Jones, or thar'll be doin's between you an' me."</p>

<p>The place where this conversation was going forward
was a hole in the hillside&mdash;an excavation consisting of a
single room with a door and a window in the front wall.
A shelf of earth running around three walls offered a
place to sit, as well as a convenient ledge for the stowage
of food supplies and cooking utensils.</p>

<p>The window was darkened with a blanket, so that the
light would not shine through and acquaint any chance
passers with the fact that the interior of the hill was
occupied.</p>

<p>Pecos Jones was a little ferret of a man. His face had
"undesirable citizen" written all over it.</p>

<p>Siwash Charley was larger, and on the principle that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
there can be more villain in a large package than in a
small one, Siwash was the more undesirable of the two.</p>

<p>He banged the table and scowled so savagely that
Pecos Jones pulled himself together with a startled jerk.
Before he could say anything, however, a set of knuckles
drummed on the door.</p>

<p>Pecos gasped, and stared in affright at Siwash. The
latter muttered under his breath, grabbed up a revolver
that was lying on the table and stepped to the door.</p>

<p>"Who's thar?" he demanded huskily.</p>

<p>"Murg," came a muffled reply from the other side of
the door.</p>

<p>Siwash laughed, shoved a bolt, and pulled the door
wide.</p>

<p>"Come in, Murg," said he. "I was sorter expectin'
ye."</p>

<p>A smooth-faced man, wearing gauntlets, a long automobile
coat, and with goggles pushed up above the visor
of his cap, stepped into the room. He carried a rifle over
his arm, and for a moment he stood blinking in the yellow
lamplight.</p>

<p>Siwash Charley closed the door.</p>

<p>"Got yer ottermobill fixin's on, eh?" said he, facing
about after the door had been bolted; "an' by jings, if ye
ain't totin' of er Winchester. Them fellers at Totten
arter you, too, Murg?"</p>

<p>Murgatroyd's little, gimlet-like eyes were becoming
used to the lamplight. They shot a reproving glance at
Siwash, then darted to Pecos Jones.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" he asked curtly.</p>

<p>"Him?" chuckled Siwash. "Oh, he's the Artful
Dodger. I reckon he does more dodgin' across the international
boundary line than ary other feller in the Northwest.
Whenever things git too hot fer Pecos Jones in
North Dakotay, he dodges inter Manitoby, and vicer
verser. Hoss stealin' is his line."</p>

<p>"Never stole a hoss in my life!" bridled Pecos Jones.</p>

<p>"Thunder!" snickered Siwash. "Why, I've helped ye."</p>

<p>"How does Pecos Jones happen to be here?" demanded
Murgatroyd.</p>

<p>"He got ter know this place o' mine while we was
workin' tergether. Arter that flyin' machine was tried
out at Fort Totten, o' course I had ter slope ter some quiet
spot whar I could go inter retirement, an' this ole hang-out
nacherly suggested itself. When I blowed in hyer,
lo! an' behold, hyer was Pecos."</p>

<p>Murgatroyd appeared satisfied. Standing his rifle in
one corner, he pulled off his gauntlets and thrust them in
his pockets, sat down on the earth shelf, and hooked up
one knee between his hands. For a while he sat regarding
Siwash reflectively.</p>

<p>"Is Pecos Jones known at Fort Totten?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Bet yer life I ain't," said Pecos for himself. "What's
more," he added, nibbling at a slab of tobacco, "I don't
want ter be."</p>

<p>"He works mostly around Turtle Mounting," explained
Siwash Charley. "Why?"</p>

<p>"I think he can be useful to us," answered Murgatroyd.
"Those other two fellows who helped you at
Totten&mdash;where are they, Siwash?"</p>

<p>"They was nigh skeered ter death, an' made a bee
line fer Winnipeg."</p>

<p>"That was a bad bobble you made at Totten," resumed
Murgatroyd. "Motor Matt, in spite of you, put Traquair's
aëroplane through its paces, met the government's
requirements in every particular, and the machine
was sold to the war department for fifteen thousand
dollars."</p>

<p>"Things didn't work right," growled Siwash. "I tampered
with that thar machine the night before the trials&mdash;loosened
bolts an' screws an' filed through the wire guy
ropes&mdash;but nothin' happened till the flyin' machine was
done sailin' an' ready ter come down; then that cub,
Motor Matt, got in some lightnin' headwork an' saved
the machine, saved himself, an' likewise that there Leftenant
Cameron of the Signal Corps."</p>

<p>"The boy's got a charmed life, I tell ye," insisted
Pecos Jones. "I've heerd talk, up around Turtle Mounting,
about what he's done."</p>

<p>"Think of a full-grown man like Pecos Jones talkin'
that-a-way!" exclaimed Siwash derisively.</p>

<p>"Motor Matt is clever," said Murgatroyd musingly,
"and I made a mistake in sizing him up. But there's a
way to get him."</p>

<p>"What do you want to 'get' him fer?" inquired Pecos
Jones.</p>

<p>Murgatroyd drew three gold pieces from his pocket
and laid them in a little stack on the table, just within the
glint of the lamplight.</p>

<p>"Pecos Jones," said he, "Siwash, here, has vouched for
you. In the little game I'm about to play we need help.
You can either take that money and obey orders, or leave
it and get out."</p>

<p>There was a silence, while Pecos eyed the gold greedily.
After a little reflection he brushed the coins from
the table and dropped them clinking into his pocket.</p>

<p>"I'm with ye," said he. "What's wanted?"</p>

<p>"That's the talk," approved Murgatroyd. "Our plans
failed at the aëroplane trials,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> but I've got another
scheme which I am sure will win. You know, Siwash,
and perhaps Pecos knows it as well, that Motor Matt was
demonstrating that aëroplane for Mrs. Traquair, who
lives in Jamestown. Motor Matt came meddling with the
business which I had with the woman, and the fifteen
thousand, paid by the government for the aëroplane, was
divided between Mrs. Traquair and Matt. Half&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> What Murgatroyd's plans were, and why they failed, was set
forth in No. 24 of the <span class="smcap">Motor Stories</span>, "Motor Matt on the Wing;
or, Flying for Fame and Fortune."</p></div>

<p>"We know all that," cut in Siwash.</p>

<p>"Well, then, here's something you don't know. Mrs.
Traquair has a quarter section of land near here, on
which her husband borrowed one thousand dollars of me
while perfecting his aëroplane. After Traquair was
killed by a fall with his flying machine, I felt sure I could
get that quarter section of land on the mortgage. Now
Motor Matt, by helping Mrs. Traquair, has made it possible
for her to pay off the mortgage. She hasn't done
it yet, because I haven't been in Jamestown since your
failure to wreck the aëroplane at Fort Totten. I've been
traveling around in my automobile with my niece, who is
in poor health. She is in Sykestown now, while I am
making this night trip out here. I visited this place once
before, you remember, and I kept its location so well in
mind that I was able to find it without much trouble. I
felt fairly certain, Siwash, that you would be here,
so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what's your scheme?" interrupted Siwash Charley.</p>

<p>"I'm getting to that," went on Murgatroyd. "Motor
Matt and his friend Joe McGlory, together with the Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
boy, Ping Pong, have been at Fort Totten ever since
the aëroplane was sold to the government. The war department
will take another of the Traquair aëroplanes at
the same price paid for this one in case it can be finished
and delivered by the first of the month, in time to go to
Washington for trials of dirigible balloons and other devices
at Fort Myer. Motor Matt is building an aëroplane
for this order, and it is nearly completed. I don't care
anything about that. What concerns me is that quarter
section of land. For reasons of my own, I want it&mdash;and
I am going to have it, if not in one way, then in
another."</p>

<p>"What's yer scheme?" asked Siwash Charley impatiently.</p>

<p>"My scheme is to give Motor Matt such a reverse that
Mrs. Traquair will have to come to his rescue and buy
his safety with the quarter section."</p>

<p>"Ye never kin do it!"</p>

<p>"I believe that I can." Murgatroyd took a letter from
his pocket and laid it on the table. "That," said he, nodding
toward the letter, "is to be delivered to Motor Matt
at Fort Totten by Pecos Jones, and Jones is to tell a story
which will run substantially like this."</p>

<p>Thereupon Murgatroyd entered into a more lengthened
review of his crafty scheme, Siwash Charley's eyes gleaming
exultantly as he proceeded.</p>

<p>"It's goin' ter win!" declared Siwash, thumping a fist
down on the table to emphasize his declaration. "I've
got ter saw off even with that young cub, an' I'm with ye,
Murg, chaps, taps, an' latigoes! So's Pecos. Ye kin
count on the two of us."</p>

<p>"Very good," responded Murgatroyd, getting up and
drawing on his gauntlets. "Succeed in this, Siwash, and
I'll not only secure the quarter section, but you and Pecos
will get more money and, what's better, a promise from
the government not to trouble you because of what happened
at Fort Totten&mdash;or what's going to happen. You
understand what you're going to do, so no more need be
said. I'll get away before my absence from Sykestown
arouses any remarks. So long."</p>

<p>The door closed, and presently the two in the dugout
heard the muffled "chugging" of a distant motor car
fading into silence in the direction of Sykestown.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE NEW AEROPLANE.</p>


<p>Motor Matt was as happy as the proverbial bee in
clover&mdash;and fully as industrious.</p>

<p>A quarter of a mile below the post trader's store, on
the Devil's Lake Indian Reservation, a tent, with its sides
rolled up, was being used as a workshop. Outside the
tent there was a portable forge, anvil, and full outfit of
blacksmith's tools. Inside there was a bench with an
ironworker's vise, and also a carpenter's bench and well-equipped
chest.</p>

<p>For two weeks Matt had been laboring about Camp
Traquair, as the little rendezvous was called, assisted in
his work by his cowboy chum, Joe McGlory, and with
the Chinese boy, Ping, in charge of the culinary department.</p>

<p>Immediately after Matt had finished the aëroplane
trials, with so much credit to himself, an order had been
given for a new aëroplane at the same price the government
had paid for the first one, providing only that it
should be finished and tried out by the first of the month.
This would enable the machine to be taken apart, crated,
and forwarded to Fort Myer for a competitive test in
an event that was to determine the abilities of an aëroplane
for signal corps' services, as against other types
of machines, such as dirigible balloons.</p>

<p>Matt and his two friends had plunged zealously into
the work. While McGlory and Ping were erecting the
work tent, and furnishing it with wood and iron-working
tools, Matt had made a trip to Jamestown for a talk with
Mrs. Traquair, and then to St. Paul after materials.</p>

<p>The tough spruce needed for the wings, or "planes,"
every bolt, screw and wire guy, and the motor, Matt had
secured in St. Paul. At a large cost for expressage these
materials had been shipped direct to Fort Totten and had
arrived there on the same day that witnessed Matt's return.</p>

<p>Then began a season of feverish activity, during which
Lieutenant Cameron and others from the post had
watched the king of the motor boys with wonder and
admiration.</p>

<p>That Motor Matt was possessed of mechanical skill
the officers at the post had long known, but that his
genius in construction was fully equal to his ability as
an aviator became evident from day to day, and was in
the nature of a revelation.</p>

<p>"You're the best all-around chap at this business I ever
saw in my life," Lieutenant Cameron had declared.</p>

<p>Matt laughed.</p>

<p>"Why, Cameron," he answered, "I used to work in a
motor plant, in Albany, New York."</p>

<p>"That may be, Matt, but building a motor is a different
proposition from building a flying machine."</p>

<p>"Traquair laid down the plans. All I have to do is to
follow them. It's really very simple. An aëroplane, you
know, is nothing more than two oblong pieces of canvas,
fastened together one above the other and pushed against
the air by a motor and propeller. If the motor drives the
wings fast enough, they're sure to stay up."</p>

<p>But Cameron shook his head and continued to believe
that Motor Matt was something of a phenomenon,
whereas Matt knew that he had merely the "knack" for
the work, just as he had acquired the "knack" for using
the aëroplane in the first place.</p>

<p>"The machine," he declared to Cameron, "is only a big
toy."</p>

<p>"Toy?" echoed Cameron. "It's more than that, Matt."</p>

<p>"For the army and navy, yes. Aëroplanes can be used
for scouting purposes and for dropping bombs down on
hostile armies and war ships&mdash;providing they can keep
clear of bullets and shells fired from below; but, even for
such work, the aëroplane has its limitations."</p>

<p>"The government," laughed Cameron, "is buying these
Traquair aëroplanes in spite of their limitations."</p>

<p>"Our war department," answered Matt, "has got to
keep abreast of other war departments, and poor Traquair
has given you fellows the best aëroplane so far invented."</p>

<p>"Don't you think the Traquair machine will ever be
used for commercial purposes? Won't there be fleets of
them carrying passengers and merchandise between San
Francisco and New York and making the trip at the rate
of sixty or one hundred miles an hour?"</p>

<p>"That's a dream," averred Matt; "still," he added,
"dreams sometimes come true. My old dirigible balloon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
the <i>Hawk</i>, was a wonder. She could be sailed in
a pretty stiff wind, and a fellow didn't have to use his
head and hands every blessed second to keep a sudden
gust of air from turning his machine upside down. I
traveled thousand of miles in the <i>Hawk</i>, but there was
always a certain amount of worry on account of the gas.
If anything happened to the silk envelope, no amount of
work with your head and hands could keep you from a
tumble."</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, you're in love with air ships."</p>

<p>"I'm in love with this," and Matt's gray eyes brightened
as he touched the motor which he was at that moment
installing in the new aëroplane, "and I'm in love
with every novel use to which a motor can be put. Explosive
engines will furnish the power for the future, and
every new way they're used helps that coming time along.
But I'm giving a lecture," he smiled, going back to his
work, "and I couldn't tell you exactly how I feel on this
gas-engine subject if I talked a thousand years. The
motors have got a strangle hold on me&mdash;they're keeping
me out of college, keeping me from settling down, and
filling my life with all sorts of adventures. But I can't
help it. I'm under the spell of the gas engine, and that's
all there is to it."</p>

<p>It was during this talk of Matt's with Cameron, along
toward the last days of the busy two weeks, that Ping
came into Camp Traquair with a dagger.</p>

<p>"You savvy knife, Motol Matt?" asked Ping, offering
the dagger for inspection.</p>

<p>Matt dropped his wrench and took the weapon from
the Chinaman.</p>

<p>It was not more than seven inches in length from the
end of the handle to the tip of the blade. The blade was
badly rusted, and the handle was incrusted with earth.</p>

<p>"Where did you get this, Ping?" inquired Matt, beginning
to clean the dagger with the edge of a file.</p>

<p>"My makee find in woods. You savvy place Siwash
cally Ping one piecee night he fool with Flying Joss?"</p>

<p>"Flying Joss" was Ping's name for the aëroplane. His
heathen mind made a joss of things he could not understand,
and this machine of Traquair's had impressed him
more than anything else he had ever encountered.</p>

<p>"I remember," answered Matt. "Siwash Charley carried
you off into the timber, near the lake shore. You
found the dagger there?"</p>

<p>"All same."</p>

<p>"Some Indian must have dropped it," put in Cameron.
"From the way it's rusted, it looks as though the redskin
must have dropped it a hundred years ago."</p>

<p>"Hardly as long ago as that," returned Matt. "It's
a pretty dagger, as daggers go, although I don't admire
things of the kind. The blade is of mighty fine steel, and
the handle is of sterling silver, set with a ruby, or a piece
of colored glass to represent a ruby, at the end. And
here are some initials."</p>

<p>A little scraping with the file had bared a flat plate in
the handle. Matt studied the initials.</p>

<p>"No," he remarked, "this couldn't have belonged to an
Indian, Cameron. Redskins are not carrying silver,
ruby-mounted daggers with initials engraved on them."</p>

<p>"Some red may have traded pelts for it," suggested the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>"What are the initials? Can you make them out?"</p>

<p>"There are two letters, sort of twined together," answered
Matt. "I make them out to be 'G. F.,' although
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>An exclamation escaped Cameron.</p>

<p>"Let me see it!" he cried, stepping forward and showing
an astonishment and eagerness which bewildered Motor
Matt.</p>

<p>For several minutes Cameron turned the blade around
and around in his hands, staring in amazement and muttering
to himself.</p>

<p>"Will you let me have this for a little while, Matt?"
asked the lieutenant when he had finished his examination.
"This may be a most remarkable find&mdash;remarkable
as well as of tremendous importance. I can't tell about
that, though, till I have a talk with some of the others
at the post."</p>

<p>"Of course you can take it," said Matt. "But what
makes that rusty piece of steel so important?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you&mdash;later."</p>

<p>Thereupon the lieutenant whirled in his tracks and
made off at speed in the direction of the post.</p>

<p>McGlory had been under the aëroplane fitting in the
pipe that led from the tank to the carburetor. He had
overheard the talk, however, and had caught a glimpse
of the dagger while the lieutenant was examining it.</p>

<p>"Tell me about that!" he exclaimed, crawling out from
under the aëroplane. "There was something about that
rusty old knife that knocked Cameron slabsided. What
do you think it was?"</p>

<p>"Give it up, Joe," answered Matt. "How much too
long is that pipe?"</p>

<p>In this offhand way Matt dismissed the dagger from
his thoughts&mdash;but not for long. An hour later, Cameron
could be seen chasing down the road from the post
trader's, wildly excited.</p>

<p>"I've got to talk with you, Matt," said he breathlessly,
as he reached the side of the aëroplane. "You'll have to
give me some of your time, and no two ways about it.
There's a tragedy connected with this knife&mdash;tragedy, and
a whole lot of treachery. It's more than likely, too, that
Siwash Charley is mixed up in the whirl of events that
have to do with the dagger. Come into the tent with me
for a little while."</p>

<p>Matt gave a regretful look at the motor. He would
rather have kept busy with that than listen to the most
absorbing yarn that was ever told. Nevertheless, there
was no denying the lieutenant, and the king of the motor
boys, accompanied by McGlory and Ping, followed Cameron
into the shade of the tent.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">TREACHERY AND TRAGEDY.</p>


<p>"I'm no hand at spinning yarns," remarked Cameron
after he and the rest had seated themselves comfortably
in canvas chairs, "but this is no yarn. It's history, and
has to do with the dishonor of a brother officer, one Captain
Goff Fortescue, of the &mdash;th Infantry, who, two years
ago, was stationed at Fort Totten. It isn't pleasant for
me to tell of a brother officer's disgrace, but the story will
have to be repeated or you won't be able to understand
what the finding of this dagger means."</p>

<p>"The knife belonged to Captain Goff Fortescue?"
asked Matt, remembering the initials on the handle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. There now appears to be not the least doubt of
that. I went up to the post and showed the knife to a
member of the Signal Corps who used to belong to Fortescue's
company. He declares that he has seen that
dagger in Fortescue's possession a dozen times. Fortescue
picked it up in Italy once while he was abroad&mdash;in
Italy, the home of the stiletto. He was very proud of it,
and always had the weapon about him, in a small sheath."</p>

<p>Cameron was silent for a little, examining with pensive
eyes the rusted dagger which he had laid on a table in
front of him.</p>

<p>"Fortescue came to Totten from the Presidio, at San
Francisco," he finally went on. "I presume you have
heard how eager one nation is to secure the plans of
another nation's defenses&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know a good deal about that," interjected Matt
grimly. "Other nations are just as eager to find out
about submarine boats belonging to another nation&mdash;and
to destroy them, if possible. When your cousin, Ensign
Glennie, went around South America with me in the
submarine <i>Grampus</i>, we had our hands full keeping clear
of the Japs."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Cameron. "I know about that. Well,
our defenses in and around San Francisco Bay, their
strength as to guns and calibre of the guns, the situation
and power of the disappearing cannon, and all that,
might become of importance to several nations. Such information,
if it can be secured, is well paid for. That is
the pit into which poor Fortescue dropped&mdash;killing as
bright a prospect as ever lay before any officer in the
service.</p>

<p>"While Fortescue was stationed at Totten, he went
across to Devil's Lake City on a week's leave. His excuse
was that he had to make a business trip to St. Paul,
and when he went he carried a suit case with him. The
eastbound train was late, and Fortescue checked his suit
case at the hotel and went to pass an hour or two with
friends. In some way, the clerk at the hotel mixed the
checks, and a commercial traveler from Omaha got
Fortescue's grip by mistake, while Fortescue was visiting
his friends.</p>

<p>"Both grips, it transpired, looked exactly alike&mdash;you've
seen suit cases that way, I guess&mdash;and when the drummer
took the grip to his room he was surprised to find that his
key wouldn't unlock it. It was necessary for the drummer
to get into the case, and he broke the lock. Instead
of finding what he was looking for, he discovered a mass
of plans and blue-prints, with sheet after sheet of memoranda,
all descriptive of our defensive works in and
around San Francisco!</p>

<p>"Naturally, the drummer was astounded. Then, for
the first time, he looked at the lettering on the end of the
suit case. Just as you found on that dagger, he discovered
on the suit case the initials, 'G. F.' While he was
looking over the documents Fortescue burst wildly into
the room and demanded his property. Of course, the
drummer gave up the suit case and the papers. He
thought no more of the matter just then, for Fortescue
was an officer of the army and, the drummer believed,
entitled to the documents.</p>

<p>"Three days later Fortescue was discovered dead in
the woods not far from the place where Ping was found
by the Indian the afternoon of the aëroplane trials. He
had been slain by a dagger thrust and stripped of all his
personal possessions. There was no marks of a scuffle,
and the affair became a great mystery, for Fortescue's
dagger&mdash;that dagger&mdash;was missing, although the sheath
was still in Fortescue's breast pocket.</p>

<p>"The news got out. The drummer, who was at Grand
Forks, read an account of the affair in a newspaper, and
immediately started for Totten. He told what he knew
about the plans in Fortescue's satchel. This information
pointed to shame and disgrace, in the matter of Fortescue,
but every one reserved judgment, not wishing to
judge the captain until more concerning the affair had
come out.</p>

<p>"Fortescue had started for St. Paul. Why had he not
gone there? Instead, he was found south of the lake, in
the woods, dead from a dagger thrust.</p>

<p>"Why had he the plans and memoranda in his possession?
And where were the suit case and the plans?"</p>

<p>"Some thought he had been going to sell the plans to
the agent of some foreign nation, that he was afraid the
commercial traveler would tell of the mistake made in the
hotel, and that he had got rid of the satchel and taken his
own life. The bottom of the lake, just off the place
where Fortescue was found, was dragged, but the satchel
could not be found. Nor has it been found to this day."</p>

<p>Cameron paused.</p>

<p>"That's what happened, Cameron," said Matt. "Fortescue
was treacherous. When he saw he had been discovered,
his treasonable designs so worked upon him
that he probably destroyed the satchel and the plans and
killed himself."</p>

<p>"Wait, Motor Matt," proceeded Cameron; "there's
more to it. The same day Fortescue started across
Devil's Lake to take the train east, a soldier named Cant
Phillips deserted from Fort Totten. This Phillips also
came from the Presidio, and belonged with Fortescue's
company. The soldier was never found&mdash;and this, you
will remember, happened two years ago."</p>

<p>"But what has Phillips to do with Fortescue and the
plans?"</p>

<p>"Here is where guesswork comes in. Ping found the
knife on the spot where Siwash Charley and two of his
villainous comrades carried the boy the night the aëroplane
was tampered with. Suppose Siwash Charley had
dropped the knife?"</p>

<p>"More likely," returned Matt, "Fortescue dropped it
after he stabbed himself."</p>

<p>"No. The ground was searched all around in that vicinity,
and the knife could not be found. If Fortescue
gave himself a mortal wound, he would have had to drop
the knife on the spot. It wasn't there at that time. The
knife, as a matter of fact, hasn't laid so long in the woods
as its appearance would indicate. The rust is only on the
surface of the steel, and fifteen minutes' work will clean
the dagger so that it will be almost as bright as ever. I
don't think it has been in the woods more than two weeks.
In short, it's my notion that Siwash Charley dropped it
when he and his pals carried Ping to the place where he
was left."</p>

<p>This was rather startling, but still Matt and McGlory
were unable to puzzle out the point Cameron was driving
at.</p>

<p>"How could Siwash Charley get hold of the knife?"
asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Siwash Charley appeared in this part of the country,
from nowhere in particular, some year and a half ago.
He was accused of stealing horses, but the crime was
never proved against him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm a Piute," breathed McGlory, "if I can see what
Siwash has to do with this Fortescue party."</p>

<p>Without seeming to notice the comment, Cameron
went on:</p>

<p>"Cant Phillips may have been concerned in the treachery
that has to do with Fortescue's plans. Possibly he
met Fortescue in the woods, here to the south of the lake,
the day he deserted; that he and Fortescue quarreled; that
Phillips felled Fortescue with a blow of the fist and then
took the dagger from Fortescue's pocket and completed
his work; and then, following that, Phillips may have
skipped out with the suit case, the plans&mdash;and the dagger."</p>

<p>"But how," said Matt, still puzzled, "could Siwash
Charley get the dagger from this man Phillips, assuming
that what you guess about the affair is true?"</p>

<p>"I believe," and here Cameron leaned forward and
spoke sternly and impressively, "that Cant Phillips and
Siwash Charley are one and the same!"</p>

<p>Matt, McGlory, and even Ping were profoundly
stirred by this announcement.</p>

<p>"But," cried Matt, "does Siwash Charley look like Cant
Phillips?"</p>

<p>"Not much, so far as I've been able to discover. Still,
two years will make a big change in a man&mdash;especially if
the man does what he can to help on the change. Fortescue
killed himself two years ago, and it was a year and
a half ago that Siwash Charley appeared in this part of the
country. At times there is a soldierly bearing about Siwash
Charley which may have been the result of training
in the army. Besides, he is about the height and build of
Phillips. A soldier looks vastly different out of his uniform
and in rough civilian clothes."</p>

<p>"Then," observed Matt, watching through the open side
of the tent as a horseman came galloping down the road
from the direction of the post trader's, "the military have
a double purpose in capturing Siwash Charley."</p>

<p>"They will have," declared Cameron grimly, "as soon
as I air my suspicions. For the present, though, keep
what I have said to yourself. Ah," he finished, as the
horseman drew up beside the tent, "a visitor, Matt, and
rather a rough one, at that."</p>

<p>Cameron excused himself, picked up the fateful dagger,
and started back toward the post. Matt stepped out
to pass a few words with the horseman, while McGlory
went to his work on the aëroplane.</p>

<p>"My name's Hackberry," said the horseman, a wiry,
ferret-like figure of a man, "an' I got a letter here fer
Motor Matt. Which is him?"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">MURGATROYD'S FIRST MOVE.</p>


<p>Motor Matt was a keen reader of character. At first
glance, and from a distance, he had not liked Hackberry's
appearance any too well; and now, at closer view, he
liked it less.</p>

<p>"I am Motor Matt," said he.</p>

<p>"Sho," muttered the horseman; "hit it first clatter out
o' the box, didn't I?"</p>

<p>After a cautious look around, he dismounted and
thrust his arm through the loop of the bridle.</p>

<p>"What I got to say is private," said he, "an' I guess
we better go off some'r's by ourselves."</p>

<p>"We couldn't talk with any more privacy if we were a
hundred miles away. Where are you from, Mr. Hackberry?"</p>

<p>"From over in Wells County. Ye see, I got a claim
over there, an'&mdash;&mdash; But say, are ye plumb sure it's safe
fer us ter talk? I was warned ter look out fer Siwash
Charley an' his friends, and fer any other tinhorns that
might be workin' fer Murgatroyd."</p>

<p>"Who warned you?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Traquair."</p>

<p>"Then you're from Jamestown?"</p>

<p>"Not much I ain't! Mrs. Traquair ain't in Jimtown.
Say, what sort of a lookin' feller is this Siwash Charley?"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that just now. Siwash Charley
isn't around here, nor are any other of Murgatroyd's
friends. Tell me how you came to have a talk with Mrs.
Traquair?"</p>

<p>"Well, as I was sayin', I got a claim over t'other side
o' Sykestown. It jines corners with a homestead Harry
Traquair took up&mdash;the same Harry Traquair what mortgaged
his quarter section fer enough ter go ter Jimtown
an' build a flyin' machine. Well, I haven't put down a
well on my claim yet, so I gits my drinkin' water from
Traquair's claim, that bein' the nighest. There ain't been
any one livin' in Traquair's shack fer a year, an' I was
kinder surprised, t'other day, when I seen a man movin'
around the place. I talked with the feller while I was
gittin' a bucket o' water, an' he says he's come there ter
take keer o' the crops. He was a tough-lookin' chap, an'
I didn't like his looks any too well, but if Mrs. Traquair
had sent him, and he suited her, why, he ort ter suit me,
too.</p>

<p>"While I was talkin' with the man, me by the pump
an' facin' the side of the house, an' him standin' with his
back to the wall, a piece of paper was pushed out from
between the boards an' dropped down on the ground.</p>

<p>"At first I was goin' ter tell the man about it, an' then
I allowed it was purty queer&mdash;that shack leakin' a piece o'
paper through the side that way, an' I held in about it.
You know how these claim shacks is built&mdash;some of 'em
jest throwed tergether, with cracks between the boards
big enough ter heave a dog out of.</p>

<p>"Bymby the feller I was talkin' to excused himself an'
went inter the house. The road I took carried me along
the wall, an' as I went by I stooped down an' picked up
the paper. There was writin' on it, an' I wah plumb surprised
when I read that writin'. Here, I'll let ye see it
fer yerself."</p>

<p>Hackberry dug up a three-cornered scrap of brown
paper from the depths of his pocket, shook some loose
tobacco out of it, and handed it to Matt.</p>

<p>Matt managed to make the following out of the hastily
written scrawl:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have been waiting, Mr. Hackberry, and trying to
get word to you. If you see this, and pick it up, it will
inform you that I was lured to this place from Jamestown,
that I am being kept a prisoner here, and that I
must talk with you as soon as possible, or the homestead
will be taken away from me. Come quietly to the side of
the house, where you picked up this paper, at night. I
can whisper to you what I want, and the man who is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
keeping me a prisoner will never know. You used to be
a friend of poor Harry's, so I hope you will help me.</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Mrs. Traquair.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>It would have been hard to describe Matt's feelings as
he read this penciled scrawl. It had been a week since
he had received a letter from Mrs. Traquair, and the
cunning Murgatroyd might have carried out many underhand
plans in a week!</p>

<p>"Did you go to the house that night, Mr. Hackberry?"
asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Did I? Why, o' course I did. Bein' such a friend o'
Harry Traquair's, why shouldn't I try ter help his wife?
They was allus good neighbors."</p>

<p>"What did Mrs. Traquair say to you?"</p>

<p>"What we said was all whisperin' an' through a knot
hole that was broke out in the wall. She said a feller
named Murgatroyd had wanted ter git the homestead
away from her, an' that he wasn't goin' ter let her go
back ter her children until she give him a quitclaim deed
ter the hundred an' sixty. I told her ter let me go ter
Sykestown an' git the deperty sher'ff, an' that him an'
me 'u'd snake her out o' that shack too quick. But she
wouldn't allow that. 'No,' she says, an' her voice was
that sobbin' an' plaintive it would have moved a heart o'
stone; 'no,' she says, ''cause then Murgatroyd might hear
what was goin' on an' have me took away ter some other
place.' She d'ruther have me, she says, come ter Fort
Totten an' give a letter ter Motor Matt. 'He'll know
what ter do,' she says, 'an' he's a lad o' fine sperrit, an'
I owe him a lot.' So she poked out this letter, an' I've
rid hossback all the way from my shack, an' I been all o'
two days makin' the trip."</p>

<p>As he finished, Hackberry dug up the letter from another
pocket. It was inclosed in a soiled yellow envelope
and was addressed to "Motor Matt, Fort Totten."</p>

<p>Matt tore off the end of the envelope, and drew out a
sheet of paper of the same color as that which Hackberry
had already shown him. The letter was short, but sufficiently
startling.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>: I have fallen into the hands of
Murgatroyd&mdash;Mr. Hackberry will tell you where I am.
Murgatroyd seems determined to get the homestead. I
know you will come to my rescue, but come quickly.</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Mrs. Traquair.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>"Anythin' else you want ter know?" asked Hackberry.</p>

<p>"This is terrible!" exclaimed Matt. "I can hardly
think even Murgatroyd would do such a thing."</p>

<p>"I don't know nothin' 'bout that. I ain't acquainted
none with this Murgatroyd, but I can tell ye there's some
mighty tough citizens in this here State."</p>

<p>"How in the world could Murgatroyd lure Mrs. Traquair
away from Jamestown?"</p>

<p>"Ye got me. Mrs. Traquair didn't say. We didn't
talk much more'n we had to, seein' as how the feller that
had charge o' the shack might come in on us at any
minit."</p>

<p>"And how," went on Matt, "can Murgatroyd hope to
make Mrs. Traquair give up the claim?"</p>

<p>"I guess he expects ter keep her a pris'ner until she
signs the quitclaim."</p>

<p>"A quitclaim deed, secured like that, wouldn't hold in
law for a minute! Murgatroyd has loaned enough money
to understand that."</p>

<p>"Like enough, but it's some sich game he's tryin', jest
the same."</p>

<p>Motor Matt was puzzled. Hackberry's story seemed
straight enough, but there were points about it that made
him incredulous.</p>

<p>"What ye goin 'ter do, Motor Matt?" asked Hackberry.</p>

<p>"I'm going to look after Mrs. Traquair," declared
Matt.</p>

<p>"Sure! That's what she said ye'd do. Better git a
hoss an' ride back with me."</p>

<p>"It has taken you two days to come, Hackberry. Why
didn't you come by train?"</p>

<p>"Fer one thing, I didn't have no money. Fer another,
I was afeared Murgatroyd might have some spies hangin'
around Sykestown, so I dodged the place by comin' cross-kentry.
I reckon we'd better go back the same way I
come, hey?"</p>

<p>"No, it's too slow. I'll go by train."</p>

<p>Hackberry appeared disappointed.</p>

<p>"What'll I tell Mrs. Traquair?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You'll not be able to tell her anything&mdash;I'll get to her
homestead long before you do. Where is it?"</p>

<p>"Eighteen mile due west o' Sykestown; anybody kin
tell ye the place when ye git started from Sykestown on
the main road. I won't be able ter go with ye, seein' as
how I got my hoss ter git back."</p>

<p>"Well, Hackberry, you follow Mrs. Traquair's instructions
and say nothing to any one. She evidently knows
what it is best to do. I'll look after her, and after this
man Murgatroyd, too. Mrs. Traquair has money, and
you'll be well repaid for your trouble."</p>

<p>"Money 'u'd come handy ter me, an' that's a fact," said
Hackberry, "though I'd have done this fer Mrs. Traquair
if there hadn't been a cent comin'. When'll ye start?"</p>

<p>"Just as soon as I can."</p>

<p>"Ye'll go by the way of Sykestown?"</p>

<p>"There's no other way if I go by railroad."</p>

<p>"All right, then. The responsibility is off'n my shoulders
an' onter yourn. Good-by."</p>

<p>Hackberry rode off along the road in the direction of
the town of Lallie, which lay on his homeward route.
Matt, as soon as the messenger had started, hurried up
to the post.</p>

<p>There was a telegraph office there and he sent a couple
of messages. One was to Mrs. Harry Traquair, Jamestown,
North Dakota, and asked if she was well and at
home. The other was to a lawyer in Jamestown named
Matthews, with whom Matt had some acquaintance, and
requested the lawyer to let him know, at once, whether
Mrs. Traquair and Murgatroyd were in Jamestown.</p>

<p>Matt was suspicious of Hackberry, and wanted to be
sure of his ground before he made any move. At the
same time, Matt realized that there was not a moment to
be lost if Mrs. Traquair was really being held a prisoner
in the shack on her homestead.</p>

<p>In order to get to Sykestown by train, Matt would
have to go to Carrington, change cars, and proceed on
the branch to his destination. At the post he learned that
there was a train on the branch only every other day.
More than that, the train south from Minnewaukon had
left for that day and there would not be another until
the following morning. If he waited until morning and
took the train, he would be set down in Carrington on
one of the days when the train was not running on the
branch. It seemed as though he was bound to lose at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
least two days before he could get to Sykestown, and that
it might have been better, after all, if he had gone with
Hackberry on horseback.</p>

<p>Greatly disturbed, he went back to Camp Traquair and
told McGlory the latest news.</p>

<p>"It's a scheme o' some kind," averred the cowboy.
"I'll bet money, pard, you get a telegram from Mrs. Traquair
saying she's all right."</p>

<p>But Matt received no message from Mrs. Traquair.
He did get one from Matthews, however, and Cameron
brought it down from the post.</p>

<p>Hastily Matt tore open the message and read it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Murgatroyd not in town for two weeks; Mrs. Traquair
not in town for a week. Can't find where either
has gone.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Matthews.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Matt believed, then, that Hackberry had told the truth
and that the letter was genuine. And so it happened that
Murgatroyd's first move in his rascally game was attended
with success.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A STARTLING PLAN.</p>


<p>"What's up, Matt?" asked Cameron. "You've been
sending telegrams from the post, and here's an answer to
one of them."</p>

<p>Matt repeated Hackberry's story, then showed the lieutenant
the ragged note and the letter.</p>

<p>"It's a fishy yarn," mused Cameron. "For a clever
man of business, like Murgatroyd, to extort a quitclaim
deed from a woman in that way is rank foolishness, say
nothing of the criminal part of it, which is very apt to
get the scoundrel into trouble. No, I can't believe Murgatroyd
would do such a thing. Who is this fellow
Hackberry?"</p>

<p>"He says he has a claim joining Traquair's on the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know what he says, but where is the proof
that what he says is true? This villain, Siwash Charley,
is a bitter enemy of yours, Matt, and he isn't likely to
stop at anything."</p>

<p>Matt told Cameron of the messages sent to Mrs.
Traquair and to Matthews.</p>

<p>"I haven't heard from Mrs. Traquair," he finished,
"but here's the message from Matthews."</p>

<p>Cameron read it over, his brow clouding.</p>

<p>"Do you know Matthews very well, Matt?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes. He's a friend of Mrs. Traquair's and no friend
of Murgatroyd's."</p>

<p>"Then his word, in this matter, ought to be as good as
his bond. But, how in Heaven's name, was it possible for
Mrs. Traquair to let herself be spirited away?"</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd is a loan shark," explained Matt, "and he
is full of plausible tricks. He's not in Jamestown, and
Mrs. Traquair isn't there. Hackberry's story, hard as it
is to believe, in some respects, is beginning to prove itself."</p>

<p>"I don't like it, anyhow," and Cameron shook his head
forebodingly.</p>

<p>"That's the way I stack up," declared McGlory. "I've
got a hunch that there's a screw loose in all this crossfire
of talk and letters&mdash;talk through knot holes and letters
pushed through the walls of houses. Rot!" he
grunted disgustedly.</p>

<p>"Maybe there's nothing in Hackberry's yarn," said
Matt decisively, "but I can't turn my back on it. If Mrs.
Traquair is in trouble, I must do what I can to help her
out."</p>

<p>"Sufferin' brain twisters!" cried McGlory. "Why
didn't she let Hackberry bring the deputy sheriff from
Sykestown? But, no. She had to send Hackberry over
here, using up two valuable days, just to get you."</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd might have spies in Sykestown watching
the deputy sheriff," replied Matt. "It would be easy for
the spy to carry a warning to the Traquair homestead
and have the man in charge of the shack remove Mrs.
Traquair to some other place."</p>

<p>"Gammon!" snorted McGlory. "Somebody's playin'
lame duck, you hear me."</p>

<p>Cameron brightened suddenly.</p>

<p>"You got a letter from Mrs. Traquair the other day,
didn't you, Matt?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That was a week ago," answered Matt.</p>

<p>"How does the handwriting compare? Is it the same
in the letter as it is in these two scraps brought in by
Hackberry?"</p>

<p>Matt rummaged through his satchel and brought out
Mrs. Traquair's letter. Then they all, even Ping, began
comparing the writing.</p>

<p>"I give up," said Cameron. "The writing's the same.
Suppose we take the train for Sykestown to-morrow,
Matt, and go to the rescue of Mrs. Traquair?"</p>

<p>"There's no train out of Carrington until day after
to-morrow," said Matt.</p>

<p>"Let's get a hand car, or one of these gasoline speeders,
and go over the branch to Sykestown," suggested
McGlory.</p>

<p>Matt's eyes sparkled at mention of the gasoline
speeder, for as yet he had had no experience with one of
them.</p>

<p>"We wouldn't be liable to find such a thing as a
'speeder' in a small place like Carrington," said he.</p>

<p>"Then we'll get an automobile from Devil's Lake
City," put in Cameron. "By Jupiter, Matt, I'm pretty
nearly as warm about this business as you are. An automobile,
that's the thing!"</p>

<p>"It might be hard to get one," continued Matt. "You
fellows can come in an automobile, but I think I'll go by
air line."</p>

<p>"Air line?" echoed the lieutenant, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the quiet reply. "Two hours' work will
finish the aëroplane, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" exclaimed the lieutenant, aghast; "it's
a new and untried machine. You don't know whether it
will fly or not."</p>

<p>"If it won't fly, then the government won't buy it, and
it will be a good thing for us to know that as soon as
possible. But it will fly, Cameron."</p>

<p>"But, listen," proceeded Cameron gravely. "You're
proposing a two-hundred-mile flight, straight away&mdash;something
unheard of in the use of aëroplanes. Heavier-than-air
machines have only been tried over a prescribed
course, up to now&mdash;from the starting point, through the
air, and then back to the starting point again. This plan
of yours, Matt, looks like madness to me."</p>

<p>"It would be a fine introduction of the machine to the
tests at Fort Myer if it could be said that the aëroplane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
sailed for two hundred miles over a straight-away
course!"</p>

<p>Matt's face glowed at the thought. To do something
different, something daring that would advance the science
of aviation, <i>that</i> would certainly be worth while.</p>

<p>"Besides this," pursued Matt earnestly, "I'll have an
advantage over Murgatroyd and his villainous helpers.
They will not be expecting a rescue through the air,
while they may be prepared to ward off one by automobile.
It is not impossible," he finished, with a trace of
enthusiasm, "that I may be able to pick Mrs. Traquair
up and bring her to Fort Totten in the aëroplane. Think
of that! She would be rescued by her husband's invention."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't get her to ride in that aëroplane in a
thousand years," declared McGlory. "She's scared of it,
and has been even before her husband was killed. Shucks!
Give it up pard, and go with us in the automobile."</p>

<p>Matt shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'm going in the machine," he answered. "You fellows
can follow in the automobile."</p>

<p>"Follow! Speak to me about that. Why, pard, if the
automobile is any good at all we'll lead you all the way
to Wells County."</p>

<p>"Not if there's no wind, or only a very little. I figure
that the new aëroplane can do better than sixty miles an
hour. But let's get busy, Joe; there's more work to be
done."</p>

<p>Cameron left at once to go across the lake and secure
an automobile, Ping proceeded to get supper, and Matt
and McGlory put their finishing touches on the aëroplane's
motor.</p>

<p>"Here's a thing you haven't thought of, pard," remarked
McGlory, when the last bolt had been tightened,
"and that's about sending this machine to Washington.
If anything happens to it, or if you're delayed in Wells
County, there's fifteen thousand gone up the spout."</p>

<p>"The money is not to be considered if there's a chance
of helping Mrs. Traquair," returned Matt.</p>

<p>But the possibility opened up by McGlory filled the
king of the motor boys with regret. He had set his heart
on building the new aëroplane, putting it to the test and
then selling it to the government just as he had sold the
first one. This particular machine was the work of his
own hands, while the other had been Traquair's. He was
proud of it, and it struck a pang to his heart to think
there was even a bare chance of his not being able to turn
the machine over to the government, now that it was
built. However, he put his regret resolutely behind him.</p>

<p>"I'm not looking for a reverse, Joe," said he, "at this
stage of the game. Luck's been on my side for quite a
while, and I don't believe it will go back on me. I have
yet to be caught in a losing cause&mdash;and this won't be a
losing cause if we can find and rescue Mrs. Traquair."</p>

<p>At that moment Ping showed himself around the lower
end of the tent and shouted, in his high cackle, "Suppa'
leddy!"</p>

<p>The boys ate supper. There was not much talk during
the meal, for all were thoughtful, and McGlory, at least,
was troubled with forebodings.</p>

<p>The meal over, Matt and McGlory tried the motor.
It failed to work as it should, and Matt kept at it until
it was going properly. Then, cautiously, he turned the
power into the propeller. The machine, when started according
to custom, got its initial impetus by having the
power applied to a set of bicycle wheels. The blades of
the propeller, slapping the air, however, developed a
force that started the aëroplane, and Matt had to shut off
the power in a hurry.</p>

<p>"Sufferin' race horses!" murmured the astonished McGlory.
"Who ever heard of the like of that?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Maxim discovered it first," replied Matt. "Why,
he drove a boat through the water, at the rate of six
miles an hour, merely by having a propeller turn in the
air! But let's go to bed; we've a lot on hand for to-morrow."</p>

<p>If the intrepid king of the motor boys had only guessed
what was waiting for him in Wells County, his sleep
would probably not have been so sound or so peaceful
as it was.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE AIR LINE INTO TROUBLE.</p>


<p>Motor Matt had the Wells County country firmly fixed
in his mind. He had never been over it, but he had
studied the map and secured a fairly good theoretical
knowledge. Sykestown was at the end of the branch
road, the railroads east and west, and north and south,
forming a right angle with respect to Fort Totten. Carrington,
the junction point, was at the corner of the
angle.</p>

<p>By using the aëroplane, Matt believed he could fly
straight across the gap between Fort Totten and Sykestown,
giving Carrington a wide berth. There were some
hills, but what were hills and roads to him while in the
air? Rough country would bother the automobile&mdash;it
could not affect the aëroplane.</p>

<p>Aëroplanes, Matt had gathered from his reading on
the subject, were peculiar in this, that no two machines
ever conduct themselves exactly the same in flight. A
pair of "flyers" may be built exactly on the same model,
with all dimensions and power equipment identical, and
yet the moment they leave earth and launch themselves
into the blue each develops eccentricities peculiar to itself.
In a great measure, every machine has to be "learned."</p>

<p>This was the one point that bothered Matt. Would
the new aëroplane be easy or difficult to learn? If difficult,
he might have to make a few trial flights at Camp
Traquair before setting off for Sykestown.</p>

<p>Morning dawned propitiously. The sun was bright,
the day cloudless, and only a breath of air stirring.</p>

<p>While the boys were at breakfast, Cameron came chugging
into camp with a powerful touring car&mdash;a six-cylinder,
sixty horse, so trim and "classy"-looking that Matt
had to smother a fierce desire to drop into the driver's
seat and change his plans.</p>

<p>Soldiers, under Sergeant O'Hara, were to strip the
camp while the boys were away, removing everything to
the post.</p>

<p>In building the aëroplane, Matt had made a number of
departures from Traquair's original designs. One of
these was the equipping of the flying machine with two
gasoline tanks instead of one, the supply of fuel being
taken from either at will.</p>

<p>With tanks full and oil chambers brimming, McGlory
and Cameron pushed the aëroplane into the road. Just
before Matt took his seat the lieutenant tried to force
upon him a loaded six-shooter.</p>

<p>Matt waved it away with a laugh. "I'd rather trust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
to my heels, Cameron," he said, "than to one of those
things."</p>

<p>"But you might need it," insisted Cameron.</p>

<p>"Couldn't use it if I did. When a fellow's up in an
aëroplane both hands are occupied."</p>

<p>"We'll keep up with you, pard," said McGlory.</p>

<p>"I don't think you will, Joe, if everything works as I
hope and expect. I'm going in an air line, while you
fellows will have to follow the road. Where'll we meet
in case we get separated?"</p>

<p>"Sykestown, to-morrow morning," suggested Cameron.</p>

<p>"All right," Matt answered as he took his seat on
the lower plane and swung his feet to the foot rest.
"Don't run with her to give her a start&mdash;let's see if I
can't get her off without any help."</p>

<p>McGlory, Cameron, and Ping drew away and watched.
The motor began to pop, and then to settle into a steady
hum. A pull at a lever sent the power into the bicycle
wheels. The aëroplane leaped off along the hard road,
gradually increasing its speed as the air under the wings
continued to lighten the weight on the wheels. At a distance
of a hundred feet the aëroplane soared into the air,
under perfect control.</p>

<p>Those on the ground, as well as the soldiers engaged
in stripping the camp, gave three hearty cheers.</p>

<p>"Hoop-a-la!" chattered Ping. "Him plenty fine Cloud
Joss."</p>

<p>"Matt's aëroplane is a better one than that of Traquair's&mdash;it
flies steadier," averred Cameron, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Speak to me about this!" muttered the cowboy, his
eyes on the great white machine as it swooped upward
and onward toward the west. "Let's dig out, pards," he
added, suddenly starting toward the automobile. "We've
got to put in some mighty good licks if we keep up with
Mile-a-minute Matt."</p>

<p>Ping had already thrown a bag of rations into the
tonneau of the motor car, and Cameron sprang around in
front and began cranking. Just as the engine took up
its cycle, and Cameron was starting to take his seat at
the steering wheel, McGlory called his attention to a
trooper who was galloping down from the direction of
the post trader's.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose that swatty is after, Cameron?"
the cowboy asked. "He's coming this way just
a-smoking, and look how he's waving his arms. Something's
up."</p>

<p>"We've got to wait for him," growled the lieutenant,
"and that means we lose a couple of minutes. And we
haven't got many minutes to waste," he added, with a
look at the swiftly diminishing white speck in the western
sky.</p>

<p>"Telegram for Motor Matt, leftenant," cried the
trooper, reining in his horse and jerking a yellow envelope
from his belt.</p>

<p>"You're too late, Latham," said Cameron. "Motor
Matt's swinging against the sky, a mile away."</p>

<p>"The operator says it's important," insisted Latham.</p>

<p>"I hate to tamper with Pard Matt's telegrams," remarked
McGlory, "but I reckon I'd better read this one.
What do you say, Cameron?"</p>

<p>"Read it&mdash;and be quick. I'll start, as I don't think
there'll be any answer to send back. Anyhow, if there
should be an answer we'll forward it from Minnewaukon."</p>

<p>The fretting motor had its power thrown into the
wheels. As it glided away at steadily increasing speed,
McGlory tore the end off the envelope and drew out the
inclosed sheet. The next moment he gave a wild yell.</p>

<p>The cowboy was on the seat beside Cameron, and the
latter caught his breath and gave him an amazed sidelong
look. McGlory's face had gone white under its tan
and he had slumped back in his seat.</p>

<p>"What in Sam Hill is the matter, McGlory?" cried
Cameron.</p>

<p>The cowboy jerked himself together and leaned toward
the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Overhaul the flyin' machine!" he shouted hoarsely.
"You've got to! If we don't get a word with Matt
something's sure going to happen to him."</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked the startled Cameron.</p>

<p>Ping, catching the general alarm, leaned over the back
of the seat.</p>

<p>"Telle pidgin!" he implored. "What tleleglam say,
huh?"</p>

<p>"It's from Mrs. Traquair," replied McGlory.</p>

<p>"From Mrs. Traquair?" echoed Cameron. "Then she's
got away from Murgatroyd and his rascally hirelings."</p>

<p>"Got away from 'em?" bellowed McGlory. "Why,
they never had her at that homestead! The whole
blooming business is a frame-up, just as I thought, all
along. Murgatroyd and Siwash Charley are trying to
play even with Matt. Hit her up, can't you, Cameron?
For Heaven's sake, let her out! If you don't Matt will
get away from us and drop right into the hands of those
scheming scoundrels."</p>

<p>Cameron pushed the automobile for all it was worth.
The ground raced out from under the flying wheels.
The road was like asphalt, and the speedometer indicator
ran up and up until it pointed to fifty miles an hour.</p>

<p>"Do better than that!" cried McGlory, his wild eyes
on the white speck in the sky. "You've got to do better
than that, Cameron. Matt said he could do sixty miles.
If you can't equal that, Murg and his men will beat us
out."</p>

<p>Cameron had sixty horses under the touch of his fingers,
but there was nothing he could do to send the automobile
at a faster gait.</p>

<p>"Where did the telegram come from?" he shouted,
bending over the wheel and watching the road as it
rushed toward the swaying car.</p>

<p>"From Jamestown," yelled McGlory.</p>

<p>They had to talk at the top of their voices in order to
make themselves heard in the wind of their flight.</p>

<p>"What does it say?"</p>

<p>"It says that Mrs. Traquair has been making a little
visit with friends in Fargo; that she has just got back
and found Matt's telegram; and that she is well. That
proves that this whole game is a trap&mdash;Hackberry, Hackberry's
letters, and all. Oh, sufferin' tinhorns! I'm crazy
to fight, crazy to do something to stop Matt and to put a
crimp in in that gang of sharks and double-dyed villains.
Can't you do any better than this, Cameron?"</p>

<p>Cameron was doing all that he possibly could. The
aëroplane was a mere speck against the blue of the sky,
steadily increasing the distance that separated it from the
racing automobile.</p>

<p>"We no ketchee!" panted Ping. "By Klismus, Motol
Matt all same eagle bird. Woosh! No ketchee!"</p>

<p>"The Chink's got it right, McGlory," cried Cameron.
"Unless something happens to the aëroplane we'll never
overhaul it. Matt's gaining on us right along."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"And all we can do is to watch and let him gain,"
fumed the cowboy. "I feel like I did, once, when I was
tied hand and foot and gagged while a gang of roughs
were setting fire to a boathouse in which Pard Matt lay
asleep. Oh, speak to me about this!"</p>

<p>Then, all at once, the motor went wrong, and the car
lost speed until it came to a dead stop. McGlory
groaned.</p>

<p>"Of course this had to happen," he stormed. "If
you're ever in a hurry something is bound to go wrong
with these blooming chug carts. We're out of the race,
Cameron. Take your time, take your time. Hang the
confounded luck, anyway."</p>

<p>Cameron got down and went feverishly to work locating
the trouble. Ping tumbled out of the tonneau and
fluttered around, dancing up and down in his excitement
and anxiety.</p>

<p>McGlory did not get out of his seat. Gloomily he
kept his eyes on the fading speck in the heavens until he
could see it no more.</p>

<p>"It's out of sight," he muttered heavily.</p>

<p>"The aëroplane?" asked Cameron, fumbling with the
sparking apparatus.</p>

<p>"What else do you think I mean?" snapped the cowboy,
in his worst humor. "Matt's done for, and all we
can do is sit here and let him rush on at the rate of a
mile a minute straight into the trap that has been set
for him. Sufferin' snakes! Did you ever run into anything
like this before?"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">NOTHING DOING IN SYKESTOWN.</p>


<p>Cameron, by a happy blunder, finally located the trouble,
and repaired it. McGlory had a little knowledge of
motors and he might have helped, but his dejection was
so profound that all he could do was to sit in the car,
muttering to himself.</p>

<p>"Buck up, McGlory," said Cameron, jerking the crank
and noting that the motor took up its humming tune as
well as ever. "While there's life there's hope, you know.
We'll be able to do something yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," gibed McGlory. "With a car going fifty
miles we'll be able to overhaul a flying machine doing
sixty."</p>

<p>"Of course," went on Cameron, getting into the car
and starting, "we can't expect to overtake Matt unless
something should go wrong with the aëroplane, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If anything goes wrong with the aëroplane then Matt
breaks his neck. That won't do."</p>

<p>"I was going to say," proceeded the lieutenant as he
teased the car to its best pace, "that we're to meet Matt
at Sykestown in the morning. If anything is to happen
to him, McGlory, it will be on the other side of Sykestown.
Calm down a little, can't you? We'll reach the
meeting point by morning, all right, and then we can tell
Matt about the message from Mrs. Traquair."</p>

<p>The cowboy had not thought of this point, and yet it
was so simple that it should have occurred to him before.
Instantly his worry and alarm gave way to hope.</p>

<p>"Right you are, Cameron," said he. "When I go into
a taking I always lose my head and slip a cog. We can't
catch up with Matt. That's out of the question. As you
say, though, we can sure find him in Sykestown."</p>

<p>The car swung into Minnewaukon, and there was a
momentary pause for counsel.</p>

<p>"If Matt's taking the air line, as he said he was going
to do," remarked Cameron, "then he'll be cutting the
corner between here and Sykestown. There are poor
roads and bad hills on that lap, and we'll make better
time by taking the longer way round and going by Carrington."</p>

<p>"Maybe he didn't go that way," said McGlory. "If he
has to come down for anything he'll have to have a fairly
good stretch of trail in which to get a start before the
flying machine can climb into the air. Like as not he
went by way of Carrington, himself."</p>

<p>"We'll soon settle that," and Cameron made inquiries
of a man who was standing beside the car.</p>

<p>Yes, the man had seen the aëroplane. It had passed
over the town and went southwest.</p>

<p>"That settles it, McGlory," said Cameron. "Matt cut
the corner. If he'd gone by way of Carrington he'd
have started south."</p>

<p>"He's taking a big chance on his machine going
wrong," muttered the cowboy, "but Matt can take more
chances and come out right side up than any fellow you
ever saw. It's Carrington for us, though."</p>

<p>Cameron headed the machine southward and they
flickered out of Minnewaukon like a brown streak. Nothing
went wrong, and they hit a steady, forty-mile-an-hour
gait and kept it up through Lallie, Oberon, Sheyenne,
Divide, and New Rockford. Here and there was
an occasional slough which they were obliged to go
around, but the delay was unavoidable.</p>

<p>It was three o'clock in the afternoon when they reached
Carrington, and they congratulated themselves on the
ease with which they had covered so much of their
journey.</p>

<p>They halted for an hour in Carrington, Cameron and
McGlory going over the machine and replenishing the
gasoline and oil. At four they pulled out for Sykestown,
and had barely crossed the Carrington town line before
accidents began to happen.</p>

<p>First, a front tire blew up. A flying stone gouged the
shoe and the inner tube sprung a leak.</p>

<p>An hour was lost repairing the damage. Nevertheless,
the cowboy kept his temper well in hand, for they had
not planned to reach Sykestown and meet Matt before
morning.</p>

<p>A mile beyond the place where the tire had blown up
the electricity went wrong; then the carburetor began to
flood; and last of all the feed pipe became clogged.</p>

<p>"Let's leave the old benzine-buggy in the road and
walk the rest of the way," suggested McGlory. "A pair
of bronks and a wagon for me, any old day."</p>

<p>It was eleven o'clock at night when they got into Sykestown
and pulled to a halt in front of the only hotel in
the place. There was no garage, and Cameron backed
the car under an open shed in the rear of the hotel.</p>

<p>While he was doing this, McGlory was making inquiries
regarding Motor Matt.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing, Cameron," announced the cowboy,
meeting the lieutenant as he came into the hotel.</p>

<p>"Matt hasn't got here yet?"</p>

<p>"He hasn't been seen or heard of. That's some queer,
I reckon. He took a crosscut. Coming at sixty miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
an hour, barring accidents, he ought to have reached
Sykestown by noon."</p>

<p>"Well," said the optimistic lieutenant, "it's a good
thing to know he hasn't got here and gone on without
waiting for us. Matt knows we were not to meet until
morning. He may be waiting at some farmer's shack,
somewhere out of town. Let's get a hand-out and then
go to bed. Wrestling with a refractory motor is tiresome
work."</p>

<p>This was sensible advice, and the cowboy, although he
did not accept Cameron's explanation of Matt's absence,
concluded to accept it.</p>

<p>McGlory was up at dawn, however, inquiring anxiously
for news. There was none. Taking a chair out in
front of the hotel he sat down to wait.</p>

<p>An hour later, Ping came scuffling around the corner
of the hotel.</p>

<p>"Where have you been, Ping?" McGlory asked.</p>

<p>"My makee sleep in choo-choo car," replied the Chinaman,
taking an upward squint at the sky with his slant
eyes. "Cloud Joss no makee come, huh?"</p>

<p>"Nary, Ping. I'm which and t'other about this, too.
We're up against a rough game of some kind, and I'd
give my eyeteeth to know what it is."</p>

<p>"Plaps Motol Matt makee lescue Melican lady all by
himself."</p>

<p>"There's no Melican lady to rescue, and that's the
worst of it."</p>

<p>At this moment Cameron issued from the hotel. He
had his khaki jacket over his arm and the handles of a
brace of six-shooters showed above the tops of his hip
pockets.</p>

<p>"No sign of Matt yet, eh?" he asked cheerily.</p>

<p>"Nary a sign, Cameron," replied McGlory. "Unless
something had gone crossways, he'd have been on here
early this morning."</p>

<p>"I don't believe in crossing bridges until you get to
them," said Cameron, dropping down on a bench. "You
know Motor Matt better than I do, McGlory," he went
on, "but I'm well enough acquainted with him to know
that he keeps his head with him all the time and never
gets rattled."</p>

<p>"He's the boy on the job, all right," averred the cowboy,
with a touch of pride. "But what good's a cool
head and plenty of pluck if a flying machine up-ends
with you a couple of hundred feet in the air?"</p>

<p>Cameron grew silent, and a little bit thoughtful.</p>

<p>"There was a still day yesterday," said he, at last,
"and only a bit of a breeze this morning. It's not at all
likely that any accident of that kind happened."</p>

<p>"I'm not thinking of that so much as I am of Murgatroyd
and his gang," went on McGlory. "That bunch
of tinhorns may have laid for Matt somewhere between
Sykestown and Minnewaukon."</p>

<p>"Hardly. They wouldn't be expecting him by air
ship, and across country, the way he started."</p>

<p>"Hackberry, you remember, wanted him to get a horse
and ride cross country."</p>

<p>"But Matt told Hackberry he expected to reach Sykestown
by train. Because of that, no matter what the plans
of Murgatroyd and his men were, they'd have to give
over their designs and lay for Matt somewhere between
here and the Traquair homestead."</p>

<p>"That's where you're shy some more," said McGlory.
"Hackberry, coming on horseback from Minnewaukon,
hasn't got to where Murg is, yet, so he can't have
told him what Matt was expecting to do. Take it from
me, Cameron, there was a gang on that cross-country
road, last night, layin' for our pard."</p>

<p>"Well, if there was," returned Cameron easily, "then
Motor Matt sailed over their heads. But all this is mere
guesswork," he added, "and mighty poor guesswork, at
that. We'll just wait here until Matt shows up."</p>

<p>There was a silence for a while, Ping getting a crick
in his neck holding his head back and watching the sky
toward the north and east.</p>

<p>"No makee see Cloud Joss," he murmured.</p>

<p>Neither McGlory nor Cameron paid much attention to
the report. If Matt had been coming in the aëroplane
the excitement in the town would quickly have apprised
them of the fact.</p>

<p>"I can't understand," said Cameron musingly, "what
this Murgatroyd hopes to accomplish by all this criminal
work."</p>

<p>"You can't?" echoed McGlory. "Well, Matt butted
into Murgatroyd's game and knocked his villainous
schemes galley-west. That don't make Murg feel anyways
good, does it? Then there's Siwash Charley. He's
a tinhorn and <i>mucho malo</i>, and there's no love lost between
him and the king of the motor boys. What's the
result if Murg and Siwash get Matt in their clutches?"
The cowboy scowled and ground his teeth. "You ought
to be able to figure that out, Cameron, just as well as I
can."</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd isn't anybody's fool," said Cameron.
"He's not going to go to any desperate length with Matt
and run his neck into a noose."</p>

<p>"Murg won't, but what does Siwash Charley care?
He's already badly wanted, and he's the sort of cold-game
gent who does things when he's crossed. Murg
will play safe, but Siwash is apt to break away from
Murg's plans and saw off with Matt in his own way.
What that way is I'm afraid to think about, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The noise of a motor was heard up the road, accompanied
by the hollow rumble of a car crossing the bridge
over Pipestem Creek.</p>

<p>"Another car coming this way," remarked Cameron,
looking in the direction from which the sound came.</p>

<p>Buildings intervened between the front of the hotel
and the bridge, effectually shutting off the view.</p>

<p>A moment after Cameron had spoken, however, a big
car came around a turn in the road and headed for the
hotel.</p>

<p>The car carried two passengers&mdash;a man and a woman.
The moment the car hove in sight, the proprietor of the
hotel came out and leaned against the wall of the building
near the door.</p>

<p>"I don't know what's to be done now," muttered the
proprietor. "There's only room in that shed o' mine for
one automobile, an' your machine is there. What'll Mr.
Murgatroyd do with his car?"</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd!" exploded Cameron, jumping to his
feet.</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd!" cried McGlory.</p>

<p>"Woosh!" chattered Ping. "We no ketchee Matt,
mebbyso we ketchee Murg, huh?"</p>

<p>Up to that moment there had been nothing doing in
Sykestown; but now, with startling suddenness, there
seemed to be plenty on the programme.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BROUGHT TO EARTH.</p>


<p>If McGlory, Cameron, and Ping were delighted with
the start of the new aëroplane, Motor Matt was doubly
so. Matt was "at the helm" and capable of appreciating
the machine's performance as his friends could not do.</p>

<p>Preserving an equilibrium, and riding on a more or
less even keel, is the hardest point to be met in navigating
an aëroplane. The centre of wind pressure and the
centre of gravitation is constantly changing, and each
change must be instantly met by manipulating the wings.
In the Traquair machine, equilibrium was preserved by
expanding or contracting the wing area, giving more resistance
to the air on one side and less on the other, as
necessity demanded.</p>

<p>Matt, facing westward in the direction of Minnewaukon,
could give no attention to his friends, every faculty
being required for the running of the flying machine.
Every condition that had so far developed the aëroplane
was meeting wonderfully well; but new conditions would
constantly crop out and Matt was still in doubt as to how
the great planes and the motor would take care of them.</p>

<p>At a height of a hundred feet he steadily opened up
the throttle. Faster and faster whirled the propeller, and
below the machine the prairie rolled away with dizzy
rapidity. Almost before Matt realized it he was over the
town of Minnewaukon, with the jubilant cheers of the
citizens echoing in his ears.</p>

<p>He made a half turn to lay the machine on her new
course. The inner wing dipped as the aëroplane came
around, but the expanding and contracting device kept
the craft from going to a dangerous angle, and it came
level again on the straightaway course.</p>

<p>Even on a day that seems still and quiet the air is a
veritable maelstrom of conflicting currents close to the
earth's surface. Barns, houses, hills, trees deflect the
streams of air and send them upward to churn and twist
in numberless whirlpools. To get out of this unruly atmosphere
an aëroplane must mount.</p>

<p>Having made sure of the machine's performance at a
lower altitude, Matt climbed higher. Three hundred&mdash;four
hundred&mdash;five hundred feet upward he went soaring,
then rounded gracefully into a level course and was off
at speed along the air line.</p>

<p>It would be hard to describe the exultation that arose
in the breast of the king of the motor boys. It was not
alone that he was doing with an aëroplane something
which had not before been attempted&mdash;striking out a
new line for the air navigators of the world&mdash;but it was
the joy of a new sensation that thrilled him, spiced with
the knowledge that he was rubbing elbows with death
every instant the machine was aloft.</p>

<p>On his clear brain, his steady eye, and his quick hand
hung his hope of life. A wrong twist of the lever at a
critical time would overset the machine and fling it
earthway, a fluttering mass of torn canvas, twisted wire
ropes, and broken machinery, himself in the very centre
of the wreck.</p>

<p>Higher above the earth the wind was stronger, but
steadier, and the motor hurried the aëroplane along at its
top speed.</p>

<p>It was difficult for Matt to estimate the rate at which
he was traveling. There were no landmarks to rush
past him and give him an inkling of his speed. Once,
however, he saw a farmhouse in the distance ahead;
and he barely saw it before it was swept behind and lost
to his eyes under the lower plane.</p>

<p>Wherever he saw a road he followed it. If anything
happened, and he was obliged to descend, a flat stretch
of hard earth would help him to remount into the air
again.</p>

<p>Matt had secured his watch on the seat beside him so
that he was able to glance at its face from time to time.
He had started from Camp Traquair at eight o'clock.
When the hands of the watch indicated nine-thirty, he
made up his mind to descend at the most favorable point
on the surface below him.</p>

<p>He presently found the place he wanted, hard by a
farmhouse, shut off the power and glided downward.
A kick at a footlever dropped the bicycle wheels into
position, and the aëroplane brushed against the earth of
a hard road, moved a little way on the wheels, and then
came to a stop.</p>

<p>A man and a boy, who had been watching the strange
sky monster from a wheatfield, hurried toward the machine
as soon as it had come to a stop. They were full
of excitement, and asked many questions, to all of which
Matt patiently replied while looking around to see that
wings, rudders, and motor were still in perfect condition.</p>

<p>"How far is it to Sykestown?" Matt asked, as soon
as his examination was finished.</p>

<p>"About a hundred miles," answered the man.</p>

<p>"And how far are you from Minnewaukon?"</p>

<p>"Eighty miles."</p>

<p>"Great spark plugs!" laughed Matt, resuming his seat
in the machine; "I'm traveling some, all right. I've been
only an hour and a half coming from Totten."</p>

<p>"Do tell!" gasped the man, in wonder. "Why, neighbor,
them there hossless wagons couldn't travel much
quicker'n that!"</p>

<p>"I should say not! I've some friends following me
in an automobile, but they're nowhere in sight."</p>

<p>Matt got the bicycle wheels to turning. When they
were carrying the aëroplane at the rate of thirty miles an
hour the planes took the lift of the air and swung upward
clear of the earth.</p>

<p>A pull at the gear turned the power into the propeller,
and away rushed the machine like a new style of comet.</p>

<p>"I'm going to reach Sykestown in time for dinner,"
thought Matt, "and McGlory and Cameron are not expecting
to meet me there until to-morrow morning. I'd
have time to go to the Traquair homestead to-night and
perhaps get Mrs. Traquair out of the shack and carry her
in to Sykestown."</p>

<p>The idea appealed to Matt. Talk about a test for an
aëroplane! A man&oelig;uvre of that sort would put the
Traquair machine far and away ahead of any air craft
so far invented. What heavier-than-air machine was
there that could travel away from its starting point and
keep going, asking no odds of anything but gasoline and
oil and a firm surface for launching into the void?</p>

<p>This demonstration of the new aëroplane was succeeding
beyond Motor Matt's wildest dreams.</p>

<p>"We'll not take her apart and put her in a crate to
send her to Washington," thought the jubilant young
motorist. "I'll fly her there. I didn't think the machine
could travel and hold her own like this!"</p>

<p>Having plenty of time at his disposal, he began
man&oelig;uvring at various heights, slowing down and increasing
his speed, and mounting and descending.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>In the midst of this fascinating work, he caught sight
of an automobile in the road below him. The car contained
only two passengers&mdash;a man and a woman&mdash;and
was proceeding in the direction Matt was following.</p>

<p>The car was traveling rapidly, but not so rapidly as
the aëroplane.</p>

<p>Matt decided to swing the aëroplane to a point alongside
the automobile and not more than a dozen feet above
the ground, traveling in company with the car and making
inquiries of the man in the driver's seat.</p>

<p>If he carried out his plan to go to the Traquair homestead
that night, it would be well to learn something
about the location of the farm, and the man in the automobile
might be able to give him the information he
required.</p>

<p>No sooner had he made up his mind what he was
going to do than he proceeded to put the plan into execution.
Hovering over the automobile, he slowed down
the engine, turned the small steering planes in front and
slipped down the slope of air as easily as a hawk coming
to earth.</p>

<p>Some fifteen feet above the prairie, just far enough to
the right of the automobile so that the left-hand wings
cleared the car safely, Matt struck into a horizontal
course.</p>

<p>He had not had a good look at the man in the car, as
yet, although both the man and the girl were watching
his movements with the utmost curiosity.</p>

<p>"Hello!" called Matt, still keeping his eyes ahead and
holding his mind to the work of attending to the air
ship.</p>

<p>There was no answer, or, if there was, Matt did not
hear it.</p>

<p>"Are you acquainted with the country around here?"
Matt went on.</p>

<p>"A little," came the response from the man.</p>

<p>"Could you tell me where Harry Traquair used to
live?"</p>

<p>"You'll have to bear off to the right if you go there.
The Traquair homestead is twenty miles from&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Something in the voice drew Matt's eyes quickly to
the man.</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd!" cried the young motorist. "Great
spark plugs!"</p>

<p>A twist of the rear rudder sent the aëroplane away
from the road; a touch of the lever increased the machine's
speed; then, the next moment, he would have
mounted high into the air&mdash;had not something happened.</p>

<p>The crack of a rifle came from below, followed by the
crang of a bullet on metal, a woman's scream, and a
sickening lurch of the aëroplane.</p>

<p>Matt tumbled from the lower wing, and then experienced
a shock that almost drove his spine up through the
top of his head.</p>

<p>Dazed and bewildered, he lay where he had fallen.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE COIL TIGHTENS.</p>


<p>Matt's brain was a jumble of vague and half-formed
ideas. He did not seem able to grasp any notion firmly,
or hold to it realizingly. As his brain began to clear, its
first lucid thought had to do with the rifle shot and the
man in the automobile. Instinctively he turned his head
so that he could have a view of the road.</p>

<p>The automobile had come to a halt a little distance
away. The woman, who had been riding in the tonneau
and who must have given the scream which was still
echoing in Matt's ears, had thrown open the car door
and stepped down from the machine.</p>

<p>She was young and pretty, wore a long dust-coat and
had the ends of a veil flying out behind her well-shaped
head.</p>

<p>Matt shifted his eyes to Murgatroyd. The latter was
coolly getting out of the car. Reaching back, as soon as
his feet had touched ground, he pulled a rifle from one of
the seats, turned and walked a little way toward Matt,
halted and leaned on the gun. He did not speak, but
his dark, piercing eyes roved over Matt and then leaped
on beyond, to where the aëroplane was lying.</p>

<p>Matt withdrew his gaze to give it to Murgatroyd's
fair companion.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" cried the girl, as Motor Matt lifted
himself and looked toward her.</p>

<p>"What is it to you, or that scoundrel with you,
whether I am hurt or not?" he answered angrily.</p>

<p>A hurt look crossed the girl's face. She had been
hurrying toward Matt, but she now paused and drew
back.</p>

<p>"Your business is with me, Motor Matt, and not with
my niece," snapped Murgatroyd sharply. "She doesn't
know anything about our affairs, and is undoubtedly feeling
hard toward me because I fired that shot and brought
you down."</p>

<p>"Why did you do that, Uncle Amos?" demanded the
girl shrilly. "You might have killed him!"</p>

<p>"No danger of that, Amy," was the cool answer. "I
shouldn't have tried to bring him down if he had been
high enough in the air for the fall to hurt him."</p>

<p>"Why did you try to bring him down, anyhow?"</p>

<p>The girl's alarm was merging rapidly into indignation
and protest.</p>

<p>"Well," said Murgatroyd, "I wanted to talk with him,
and he didn't seem at all anxious to stay alongside the
automobile."</p>

<p>"So you ruined his flying machine and took the chance
of hurting him!"</p>

<p>"Get back in the car, Amy," ordered Murgatroyd
sharply. "You don't understand what you are talking
about. This young rascal deserves all he receives at my
hands, and more."</p>

<p>"He doesn't look like a rascal, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you mind?"</p>

<p>Murgatroyd turned and pointed toward the car. The
girl hesitated a moment, then walked slowly back to the
automobile and climbed into the tonneau.</p>

<p>Matt, meantime, had picked himself up, glad to find
that he had no broken bones. He was bruised and sore,
and his coat was torn, but he did not care for that. He
had had a lucky escape, and just at that moment was
more concerned about the aëroplane than he was about
himself.</p>

<p>The flying machine, so far as Matt could see, did not
appear to be very badly broken.</p>

<p>"I'll hold you responsible for this, Amos Murgatroyd,"
said Matt, turning on the broker. "It was an unprovoked
attack."</p>

<p>"You've given me plenty of cause to lay violent hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
on you," answered Murgatroyd. "What are you doing
in this part of the country?"</p>

<p>"That's my business, not yours."</p>

<p>A snaky, malevolent smile crossed Murgatroyd's
smooth face.</p>

<p>"It may be my business, too," said he. "You asked
for the Traquair homestead. Is it your intention to go
there?"</p>

<p>"I don't care to discuss that point with you. Just understand
that you'll be called on to answer for all the
trouble you have caused me and also Mrs. Traquair.
This scoundrelly attack on my aëroplane will come in
for part of the accounting."</p>

<p>"Yes?" was the sarcastic response. "The machine, to
look at it from here, hasn't the appearance of being very
badly hurt. Suppose we give it a closer inspection?"</p>

<p>Matt wondered at the man's desire to learn more about
the damage to the aëroplane. It was an hour or so before
the reason was made clear to him.</p>

<p>Keeping a wary eye on Murgatroyd's rifle, Matt
stepped over to the aëroplane.</p>

<p>The bullet had struck one of the propeller blades,
snapping it off. The blade, in turn, had struck and cut
through one of the small wire cables that formed a stay
for the rear rudder.</p>

<p>"You've put the machine out of business," said Matt.
"The fall, too, may have damaged the motor pretty seriously.
I can't tell that until I make a closer examination."</p>

<p>"It will take you an hour or two, I suppose, to get the
machine repaired?"</p>

<p>"An hour or two!" exclaimed Matt. "I shall have to
get some farmer to haul it to the blacksmith shop, in
Sykestown."</p>

<p>A guileful grin swept like an ill-omened shadow across
Murgatroyd's face. Without another word he went to
the automobile, climbed to the driver's seat, leaned the
rifle against the seat beside him, and started the car. He
did not continue on toward Sykestown, but made a turn
and went back over the course he had recently covered.</p>

<p>"The scoundrel!" cried Matt. "He knew I was here
to do what I could for Mrs. Traquair&mdash;that question I
asked him about the homestead would have proven that,
even if he had not guessed it from the mere fact of my
being in this section. He injured the aëroplane to keep
me from carrying out any plan I might have for the
rescue of Mrs. Traquair. He knows it will take me
some time to get the aëroplane fixed, and while I'm doing
that he'll be moving Mrs. Traquair from the homestead
to some other place. That's why he was so anxious to
find out how badly the machine was damaged. If it
hadn't been seriously broken, no doubt he'd have put another
bullet into it. He'll pay for this if I've anything
to say about it."</p>

<p>For a few moments Matt sat down on the prairie and
looked ruefully at the helpless aëroplane.</p>

<p>This reverse meant much to Motor Matt. Quite likely
it would prevent the sale of the machine to the government,
for it was now practically certain the aëroplane
could not be repaired and turned over to the government
for shipment east by the first of the month. This would
have been impossible, even if Matt had had leisure to
repair the damage&mdash;which he did not have on account of
the necessity he was under of helping Mrs. Traquair.</p>

<p>How far back on the road the last house was situated
Matt could not remember. He would have to go there,
however, and hire the farmer to transport the aëroplane
to Sykestown. The quicker this was done, and the sooner
the damage was repaired, then the more speedily he
could use the machine in helping Mrs. Traquair.</p>

<p>If repairs were going to consume too much time, then
he could join Cameron, McGlory, and Ping and go to the
Traquair homestead in the lieutenant's borrowed motor
car.</p>

<p>Greatly cast down by his reverse, yet firmly determined
to carry out his original purpose at any cost, Matt set his
face back along the road.</p>

<p>He was guessing good and hard about the young woman
who was in the automobile with Murgatroyd. She
was the broker's niece, but she was not in favor of any
of his villainous designs&mdash;that fact was beyond dispute.
If the girl felt in this way, why had Murgatroyd had her
along while pursuing his dark schemes against Mrs.
Traquair?</p>

<p>It was an enigma that baffled Matt. He gave up trying
to guess it, and began reproaching himself for becoming
so easily entangled with the motor car and its
scoundrelly owner. He should have made sure that the
man was not an enemy before bringing the aëroplane
so close.</p>

<p>It is always easy to look back over our conduct and
discover the mistakes. In the present case, Matt was
blaming himself when there was really no cause for it.
If anything was at fault it was fate, which had brought
the disastrous encounter to pass.</p>

<p>Every step Matt took reminded him of his bruises.
His head throbbed and every bone in his body seemed to
ache. He continued to stride rapidly onward, however,
keeping his eyes constantly ahead in the hope of discovering
a farmhouse.</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw a fog of dust rising from the trail
in the distance. The cloud was moving toward him and
he had a quick thought that it might be the automobile.
The next moment the dust was whipped aside by the
rising wind, and he was sure of it.</p>

<p>The car was coming, but there was only one man in
the driver's seat. The girl had vanished from the tonneau.</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd took her to some farmhouse," ran Matt's
startled thought, "and he is coming back to try some
more villainous work." The young motorist's fists
clinched instinctively, and a fierce gleam darted into his
gray eyes. "We'll see about that," he muttered, between
his teeth.</p>

<p>The automobile came on swiftly, and Murgatroyd
brought it to a standstill close beside Matt.</p>

<p>"Get in here," the broker ordered, nodding his head
toward the tonneau.</p>

<p>"I've got other business on hand," answered Matt.
"If you're going on to finish wrecking the aëroplane&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool!" snarled the broker, standing up and
lifting his rifle. "I've invited you to get into the car, but
I can <i>order</i>, if you force me to do that, and back up the
order with this gun."</p>

<p>"You've used that gun once to-day, Murgatroyd," said
Matt, giving the broker a defiant look, "and I guess
you'll find that's enough."</p>

<p>He passed on along the roadside close to the side of
the automobile. The door of the tonneau was open. As
he came abreast of it, a form that had been hiding in the
bottom of the car leaped out.</p>

<p>Matt, taken by surprise, tried to leap away. Before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
could do so, however, he was in the grip of a pair of
strong arms, and the face of Siwash Charley was leering
into his.</p>

<p>"This hyer's once things didn't come yer way, my
bantam!" gritted Siwash Charley. "Stop yer squirmin',
or I'll give ye a tap on the head that'll put ye out o'
bizness."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE DOOR IN THE HILLSIDE.</p>


<p>In spite of Siwash Charley's threat, Matt struggled as
fiercely as he could. With a muttered curse, the ruffian
drew back one fist.</p>

<p>"Steady there, Siwash!" cried Murgatroyd. "Don't
be any rougher with him than you can help. Wait! I'll
come down there and lend a hand while we get a rope
on him."</p>

<p>Murgatroyd picked up a rope from the bottom of the
car, jumped to the ground and came rapidly up behind
Matt. Between the two of them, the scoundrels succeeded
in bearing the young motorist to the ground and
putting lashings on his hands and feet.</p>

<p>Siwash Charley lifted himself scowling and drew his
shirt sleeve across his damp forehead.</p>

<p>"He's a fighter, all right," he muttered, "but he kin
gamble on it that we've got the upper hand o' him now."</p>

<p>"You took the girl away and got Siwash Charley, eh,
Murgatroyd?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"You're a young man of rare perception," was the
broker's sarcastic response.</p>

<p>"You'll both pay for this," went on Matt steadily.</p>

<p>"Who'll make us pay?" grunted Siwash Charley. "Not
you, my bantam. I've got inter enough trouble on your
account, an' I ain't intendin' ter git inter any more."</p>

<p>This was a luminous remark of Siwash Charley's.
Matt would have liked to ask him how he expected to
keep out of trouble by continuing his lawless work, but
there was not time. Lifting the prisoner roughly Siwash
Charley heaved him onto the seat in the tonneau, and
slammed the door; then Siwash got up in front. Murgatroyd
was turning the engine over. When he was done,
he climbed to the driver's seat and started the car. He
did not go on toward Sykestown, but, as before, made in
the opposite direction.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this?" demanded Matt.</p>

<p>"Ye'll know," answered Siwash Charley, turning
around savagely, "when ye find out&mdash;an' not afore."</p>

<p>"Where are you taking me?" persisted Matt.</p>

<p>"Ye'll find that out quicker'n ye'll find out the other."</p>

<p>There was clearly no satisfaction to be got out of
Siwash Charley.</p>

<p>"Something will happen to that aëroplane," said Matt,
"if it's left alone on the prairie."</p>

<p>"Don't worry erbout that thar flyin' machine. We're
goin' ter take keer o' it."</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd," cried Matt, "if you do any more injury
to that machine, you'll have to pay for it."</p>

<p>"Sing small," answered the broker, giving all his attention
to his driving; "you'll be a whole lot wiser before
I'm done with you."</p>

<p>"That machine," went on Matt, "is to be delivered to
the government, at Fort Totten, on the first of next
month. If it isn't, I'll lose the sale of it. If you keep
me from making the sale, you'll have to pay the government
price&mdash;fifteen thousand dollars."</p>

<p>Siwash Charley lay back in his seat and guffawed
loudly.</p>

<p>"Talks big, don't he, Murg?" said he.</p>

<p>"Talk's cheap," was the laconic answer.</p>

<p>Owing to his bonds, Matt had difficulty in keeping
himself upright on the seat while the automobile pitched
and slewed along the road.</p>

<p>When two or three miles had been covered, Murgatroyd
turned the machine from the road and drove toward
a range of hills, or coteaus, that fringed the horizon
in the northwest.</p>

<p>Over the crisp, crackling grass the heavy car passed,
now and then chugging into a gopher hole and slamming
Matt around in the tonneau.</p>

<p>When they had reached the foot of the hills, Murgatroyd
followed along the foot of the range and finally
halted.</p>

<p>"This will do," said the broker. "Take the ropes off
his feet, Siwash, and make him walk. I guess he won't
try to get away. You can keep a grip on him and I'll
trail along with the rifle."</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess he won't try any foolishness with me,"
cried Siwash, swinging down from the car, "not if he
knows what's best fer him."</p>

<p>Opening the tonneau door, Siwash Charley reached in
and removed the rope from Matt's ankles.</p>

<p>"Come out here," he ordered.</p>

<p>Murgatroyd stood up in front, rifle in hand, and
watched to see that the order was obeyed. Matt supposed
that all this was to keep him from going to Traquair's
homestead and helping Mrs. Traquair. But,
bound as he was, and with two desperate men for captors,
he was helpless.</p>

<p>Without a word he got up and stepped out of the car.
Siwash Charley caught his arm and led him toward a
steep hillside, Murgatroyd following with the rifle. At
the foot of the almost perpendicular wall of earth they
stopped.</p>

<p>"Hold the gun on him, Murg," said Siwash, "while I
fix the winder so'st ter throw a little light inter the dugout."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," answered the broker curtly.</p>

<p>Siwash stepped apart. Matt, with ill-concealed astonishment,
saw him push a hand along the hillside and push<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
back a square curtain of canvas painted the color of the
yellowish brown of the dried grass. A small window
was revealed. To the right of the window another curtain
was lifted, disclosing a door. Siwash opened the
door and stepped back with an ill-omened grin.</p>

<p>"Conduct the gent inter the hang-out, Murg," he
leered.</p>

<p>"Go on," ordered Murgatroyd, touching Matt with the
muzzle of the rifle.</p>

<p>"What kind of a place is this?" asked Matt, hesitating.</p>

<p>"Look at it from the inside an' mebby ye'll have a
better notion of it," answered Siwash, grabbing Matt's
arm and hustling him through the doorway.</p>

<p>Motor Matt's heart sank when he looked around at
the earthen walls of the excavation. It looked like a
prison, and undoubtedly it was to be a prison for him.</p>

<p>"I'll make him lay down on the shelf," observed
Siwash, "an' tie him thar."</p>

<p>"Put him in a chair and tie him to that," said Murgatroyd.
"He'll have to lie down at night, and change of
position will be something of a rest for him. I don't
want to be any rougher than we have to."</p>

<p>"Bah!" snorted Siwash. "From the way ye talk,
Murg, a person 'u'd think ye had a weak heart. But I
know diff'rent. I shouldn't think ye'd be so onreasonable
when ye stop ter think o' the hole this feller's got
us both inter."</p>

<p>"He's going to get us out of the hole, and give me
something I've set my heart on, besides. I reckon he's
entitled to all the consideration we can give him."</p>

<p>Siwash kicked a chair forward and pushed Matt into
it; then, with another rope, he tied the prisoner with coil
on coil, drawn taut about his legs, waist, and shoulders.
When Siwash was done, Matt could hardly shift his position
an inch.</p>

<p>"Now," proceeded Murgatroyd briskly, "we'll have to
hurry. I left my niece at a farmhouse, and I want to
get back there and make sure that she doesn't cause any
trouble."</p>

<p>"Trouble? What kind o' trouble kin she make?"</p>

<p>"She's not used to this sort of work, and it was tough
luck that she was in the car when Motor Matt came
along in that flying machine. She's very much put out
with me because I fired a bullet into the aëroplane in
order to stop Motor Matt. She's a girl of spirit, and I
must talk with her to make sure she doesn't do something
that will play hob with my plans."</p>

<p>"Wimmen ain't no good, anyhow," growled Siwash
Charley. "Will ye go right on ter Sykestown ter-night?"</p>

<p>"I think not. It will be best to stay at the farmhouse
until I make sure whether my talk will do any good. If I
think Amy will leave my hands free, we'll make for town
in the morning."</p>

<p>Murgatroyd turned to Matt.</p>

<p>"Where's McGlory?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Matt answered.</p>

<p>"Was he to meet you in Sykestown?"</p>

<p>Matt was silent.</p>

<p>"Ye kin gamble, Murg, that cowboy feller was ter meet
him some'r's. Wharever ye find one of 'em ye're purty
sure ter find t'other. I'm wonderin' why McGlory wasn't
in the flyin' machine along with Motor Matt."</p>

<p>"If they were to meet anywhere," said Murgatroyd,
"it was in Sykestown. Motor Matt would hardly try to
rescue Mrs. Traquair alone."</p>

<p>A snaky smile accompanied the last words. Siwash
Charley chuckled.</p>

<p>"It worked like a house afire," the latter muttered.</p>

<p>"Bring writing materials, Siwash," said the broker.</p>

<p>The other went to a box cupboard, swinging against
the wall, and brought out some paper and envelopes, a
bottle of ink and a pen. These he placed on the table in
front of Murgatroyd.</p>

<p>"How many letters ye goin' ter write, Murg?" queried
Siwash, hanging expectantly over the table.</p>

<p>"Three," replied the broker. "One letter will be sent
to Lieutenant Cameron, another to Joe McGlory, and
another to Mrs. Traquair."</p>

<p>Matt could not understand these allusions to Mrs. Traquair.
If she was a prisoner at the homestead, why was
Murgatroyd writing a letter?</p>

<p>It required an hour's time to write the three letters.
Murgatroyd allowed Siwash to read each one as soon as
it was finished.</p>

<p>Siwash became jubilant as the reading progressed.
When the last letter had been gone over, he brought his
fist down on the table with a smashing blow.</p>

<p>"They'll do the trick, by jinks!" he declared. "Ye'll
git what ye're arter, Murg, an' so'll I. Thunder, but I
wisht I had your head!"</p>

<p>"It takes something of a head to make money and
keep out of jail, these times," laughed Murgatroyd, getting
up.</p>

<p>The letters were folded and put in the addressed envelopes,
and Murgatroyd slipped the three missives into
his pocket.</p>

<p>"I'm off, now, Siwash," said he, stepping toward the
door. "It may take a week to wind up this business, and
it may not take more than three days. See that the
prisoner don't get away, whatever you do."</p>

<p>"Waal, ye kin bank on me from the drap o' the hat!"
cried Siwash Charley effusively. "Blamed if I ever had
anythin' ter do with sich a slick game as this afore, an' it
does me proud ter have a hand in it. Count on me,
Murg, count on me!"</p>

<p>With a derisive grin at Motor Matt, Murgatroyd
stepped through the door in the hillside. A few moments
later Matt could hear his automobile gliding off across
the prairie.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A REVELATION FOR MATT.</p>


<p>Motor Matt, in spite of his helpless situation, was not
at all worried about his own safety. What did alarm
him, though, was the plot which Murgatroyd seemed to
be putting through with so much success.</p>

<p>Why had the broker written the letters to Cameron,
McGlory, and Mrs. Traquair? What did they contain?
And why should a letter be written to Mrs. Traquair
when she, like Matt, was supposed to be a prisoner of
Murgatroyd's?</p>

<p>These were all matters of grave import, and the king
of the motor boys turned them over and over in his
mind.</p>

<p>He knew that Murgatroyd, for some reason of his own,
was intensely eager to secure the Traquair homestead.
Probably he could have bought it for a fair amount, but
that was not the broker's way. He had made his money
by lending on mortgages, and then foreclosing, thus securing
property for a fraction of its value. This seemed
to be his desire in the present instance, and he was taking
long chances to put his plans through.</p>

<p>Siwash Charley, after the broker was gone, was in
great good humor. He gave Matt a drink of water from
a pail on the earthen shelf, and then filled and lighted
his pipe and dropped down on a cot. For purposes of
ventilation the door was left open, and Matt, his brain
puzzled and bewildered, watched the sun sinking into the
west.</p>

<p>The afternoon was drawing to a close. Somewhere,
along the road to Sykestown, McGlory, Cameron, and
Ping were making their way in the borrowed motor car.
During the night, if all went well, the party should reach
Sykestown. Matt would not be there to meet them in
the morning: but Murgatroyd would be there, and would
scarcely be able to evade Cameron and McGlory.</p>

<p>What Matt's friends would do when they encountered
the broker was problematical. Matt had abundant
faith in Cameron's good judgment, and in his cowboy
pard's courage and determination. Something of importance
would happen, the king of the motor boys was
sure, and that something would be of help to Mrs.
Traquair.</p>

<p>"What's Murgatroyd up to, Siwash?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"He knows, an' I know, but you don't," answered Siwash,
"an' what's more, ye ain't a-goin' to. So stop yer
quizzin'."</p>

<p>"Why is he writing to Mrs. Traquair if she's a prisoner
of his, out on the Traquair homestead?"</p>

<p>Once more Siwash enjoyed himself.</p>

<p>"He's goin' ter send the letter out thar," replied Siwash.
"Now stop askin' questions. Ye'd better be congratulatin'
yerself that we're handlin' ye so keerful.
Arter what ye've done ter Murg an' me, knockin' ye on
the head an' drappin' ye inter some slough wouldn't be
none too good. Howsumever, ye're wuth more ter us
alive than ye air with yer boots on&mdash;which is mainly whar
yer luck comes in. Hungry?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I'll git ye a snack."</p>

<p>Siwash went to the cupboard from which he had
brought the writing materials and secured some dried
beef and crackers. Removing a knife from his pocket,
he began cutting the dried beef into small pieces.</p>

<p>There was something about the knife that reminded
Matt of the rusty dagger Ping had found in the woods,
and recalling the dagger brought Cameron's story of Goff
Fortescue abruptly to Matt's mind.</p>

<p>The prisoner eyed Siwash sharply. There was that
about the ruffian that suggested the soldier&mdash;a certain precision
of movement acquired in the ranks. Matt began
to whistle softly.</p>

<p>For a moment Siwash Charley paid no attention; then,
as the air Matt was whistling came to him, he lifted suddenly
and glared.</p>

<p>"Stop yer whistlin'," he snapped.</p>

<p>"Do you know what that is, Siwash?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No!" almost shouted the scoundrel.</p>

<p>"They call it reveille up at the post. Here's 'stable
call'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Siwash made one spring at Matt, the knife still gripped
in his fist. He flashed the blade in front of Matt's eyes.</p>

<p>"If I thought&mdash;if I thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Siwash breathed the words hoarsely and stared menacingly
at Matt. There followed an awkward silence.
Presently Siwash turned away and went on carving the
dried beef.</p>

<p>"I don't want ter hear 'stable call' nor nothin' else,"
he snarled. "Don't like whistlin' nohow. Shut up, or
I'll put a gag between yer jaws."</p>

<p>Matt deemed it best to keep silent after that. Nevertheless,
it seemed to him as though he had touched a raw
spot in Siwash Charley's past history. Had Cameron
got the matter right? Was Siwash Charley really the
deserter, Cant Phillips?</p>

<p>When the food was ready, Matt asked Siwash to release
his hands so that he could help himself. But Siwash
refused, and the prisoner was compelled to take his
food from the ruffian's hairy paws.</p>

<p>A change appeared to come over Siwash Charley. He
was moody and reflective, and kept his pipe going continuously.</p>

<p>Leaning back against the earthen wall of the room, he
surrounded himself with a fog of vapor, which, because
of the poor ventilation of the dugout, almost stifled Motor
Matt.</p>

<p>The sun went down in a blaze of red, night fell, and
Siwash closed the door and lighted the lamp. He neglected
to curtain the window, however, which may have
been an oversight on his part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Matt fell to musing upon the aëroplane, and about the
watch which he had left on the aëroplane seat.</p>

<p>Would anything happen to the machine while he was
a prisoner in the hands of Murgatroyd and Siwash? He
roused up suddenly.</p>

<p>"Siwash," he asked, "what's going to be done with
that flying machine?"</p>

<p>"I've had all I want out o' you," growled the ruffian,
with savage emphasis. "If ye know when ye're well off,
ye'll hush."</p>

<p>Matt "hushed." Frogs began to croak, and their
husky voices came faintly to the prisoner's ears. Somewhere
inside the dugout a cricket chattered. A rat ran
over Matt's feet and a lizard crawled slowly along the
earthen shelf at his side.</p>

<p>"A pleasant hole, this," muttered Matt grimly; then,
again and again, thoughts of those three letters recurred
to his puzzled mind.</p>

<p>Siwash fell asleep in his chair, and his snores were
added to the weird sounds that drifted in from the prairie.</p>

<p>Matt's limbs, bruised and sore from the fall out of the
aëroplane, felt numb from the bonds. His whole body
was aching, and his head throbbed as though a thousand
demons were pounding it with hammers. But, in spite of
his pain and discomfort, he fell to wondering if there was
not some way by which he could free himself from his
bonds.</p>

<p>He had an invincible nature, and never gave up a fight
so long as there was breath in his body. Slowly he began
an effort to free himself. It was a fruitless attempt,
doubly bound as he was, and his desperate labors caused
the chair to overturn and land him sprawling on the clay
floor.</p>

<p>The noise awoke Siwash Charley.</p>

<p>"Tryin' ter git loose, hey?" he cried with an oath. "I
ought ter make ye sit up all night fer that, an' I got a
blame' good notion."</p>

<p>Roughly he jerked the chair upright and began removing
the coils of rope. When they were off, he examined
the cords at Matt's wrists.</p>

<p>"Go over an' lay down on the cot," he ordered.</p>

<p>Matt's feet were free, and, had the door been open, he
would have been tempted to make a dash through it and
try to lose himself from his captor in the darkness of the
open prairie.</p>

<p>Passing over to the cot he dropped down on it, and
Siwash tied him there with more coils of rope, passing
them around and around the side pieces of the cot, under
and over it.</p>

<p>The change of position was a rest, in a measure, although
the tight wrist cords kept Matt's arms numb clear
to his shoulders. It had been a trying day, and Matt
presently dropped off to sleep. The hour was late when
he closed his eyes. Although he had no means of telling
the exact time, yet he knew it could not be far from midnight.</p>

<p>A mellow chink as of metal awoke him. He opened
his eyes and saw daylight shining through the window.</p>

<p>Siwash was at the table, humped over it and counting
a small store of yellow gold. An old leather pouch lay
on the table beside the coins.</p>

<p>Matt, cramped and in an agony of discomfort, was on
the point of crying out and asking to be untied from the
cot and put back in the chair, but he saw a head push
across the window on the outside of the dugout, and the
call died suddenly on his lips.</p>

<p>It was the face of Hackberry!</p>

<p>Hope arose in Motor Matt's breast. Hackberry was a
friend, in some manner he had learned where Matt had
been taken, and he had come to his rescue!</p>

<p>Scarcely breathing, Matt watched the face of the man
at the window.</p>

<p>Hackberry was not looking at Matt, but had centred
his attention on Siwash. The latter, finishing his count
of the gold pieces, swept them from the table and into
the pouch; then, crossing to the wall by the cupboard,
he knelt down, removed a flat stone, and pushed his yellow
wealth into its cache. After placing the stone in
position once more, Siwash Charley got up and stepped
toward the door.</p>

<p>Before he could open it, the door was pushed ajar in
his face.</p>

<p>"Pecos!" exclaimed Siwash, startled.</p>

<p>"Shore," laughed Pecos. "Ye didn't think it would
take me more'n a day and a night to git back from Totten,
did ye? The hoss is plumb tired, an' I've jest picketed
him close to water an' grass. And the scheme
worked, hey?" he went on, with a grin at Matt. "I
reckoned I'd put up a purty good bluff."</p>

<p>Here was a revelation for Matt, a revelation that broke
over him in a flash and brought with it a grievous disappointment.</p>

<p>A clever trap had been laid by Murgatroyd, and, in
spite of all his precautions in testing Hackberry's story,
Matt had walked into it!</p>

<p class="chaptitle">PECOS TAKES A CHANCE.</p>


<p>"Was that story of yours a lie?" demanded Motor
Matt.</p>

<p>"Well," drawled Pecos, "it wasn't exactly the truth, not
as anybody knows of. I gave it to you jest as Murg give
it to me, an' it certainly took fine!"</p>

<p>The astounded expression on Matt's face caused Siwash
Charley to go into another roar of mirth. It was a
very good joke&mdash;to Siwash and Pecos Jones. Pecos,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
riding over to Fort Totten, had claimed to be an honest
homesteader, doing his utmost to help a neighbor in distress.
The idea of Pecos Jones posing as an honest
homesteader still further added to Siwash Charley's enjoyment.</p>

<p>"Isn't Mrs. Traquair at the homestead?" inquired Matt.</p>

<p>"Not onless she went thar o' her own accord&mdash;which
I don't reckon possible."</p>

<p>"And your claim doesn't join the Traquair quarter section?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but that's rich!" whooped Siwash Charley, wiping
his bleared eyes.</p>

<p>When Matt's amazement left him he felt a sense of relief.
It was something to know that Mrs. Traquair
wasn't in danger, something to feel that he had now only
himself to think about.</p>

<p>"I'm hungry," said Pecos Jones, throwing himself
down on the shelf. "Got any grub, Siwash?"</p>

<p>"Don't I allers have grub?" returned Siwash. "It's
thar in the cupboard, Pecos. Help yerself."</p>

<p>Pecos helped himself to a chunk of beef and a handful
of crackers.</p>

<p>"I reckon," he observed as he ate, "I ought ter have
a good bit o' money fer what I done, eh, Siwash?"</p>

<p>Siwash Charley immediately grew cold and formal.</p>

<p>"Why, you little wart," he answered, "how much pay
d'ye want fer goin 'ter Totten an' back? Ain't sixty dollars
enough?"</p>

<p>"It was my work as done the trick," protested Pecos.
"I'll bet Murg is givin' you a hull lot more'n sixty cases."</p>

<p>"That's my bizness an' Murg's. Sixty you got, an'
sixty's all ye git."</p>

<p>Pecos looked at his diminishing piece of beef reflectively.</p>

<p>"Well," he remarked, "you an' me's allers been good
friends, Siwash, so I reckon we needn't ter quarrel. Oh,
I come purty nigh fergittin'. On my way here I rode
past Jessup's shack. Murg come out an' hailed me an'
said he wanted ye ter come over there, right away."</p>

<p>"Thunder! Why didn't ye tell me afore?"</p>

<p>"Ye ain't lost much time. Take yer own hoss, don't
put a bridle on mine. My critter's all tired out. How
long'll ye be?"</p>

<p>"It won't take me more'n an hour ter go an' come,"
answered Siwash, picking up his hat. "If Murg don't
keep me long, I reckon I'll be back in an hour an' a half.
What d'ye think he wants me fer?"</p>

<p>"Give it up. He ain't tellin' me any more o' his bizness
than what he has ter."</p>

<p>"No more he ain't, an' I reckon it's a good plan, too.
I suppose it's somethin' about that niece o' his. Don't let
Motor Matt bamboozle ye. If he gits contrary, thar's
Murg's rifle leanin' in the corner."</p>

<p>"I don't need no rifle while I got these," and Pecos patted
the handles of two revolvers that showed at his hips.</p>

<p>"Waal, so long, Pecos," said Siwash, moving toward
the door. "The ole man may be in a hurry, so I'll tear
away."</p>

<p>He disappeared, and Pecos continued to munch his
bread and crackers. A few minutes later, through the
open door, Matt and Pecos saw Siwash pounding away
across the prairie.</p>

<p>Immediately Pecos Jones' manner underwent a change.
Stuffing what remained of his crackers and dried beef
into his jacket pockets, he ran to the door and watched.</p>

<p>"He's gone," murmured Pecos, "an' I got an hour,
anyway. Sixty cases, eh?" he snarled. "What I done's
wuth more, an' if Murg won't give it I take it, anyhow."</p>

<p>Without paying the least attention to Matt, who was
watching proceedings in amazement, Pecos ran to the
wall and dropped down on his knees. Removing the
big, flat stone, he threw it to one side and pushed his hand
into the secret cache. Presently he drew out the leather
pouch and gave a croaking laugh as he shook it over his
head and listened to the jingle of gold.</p>

<p>"I'll l'arn 'em ter beat me out o' what's my due!" he
cried. "I'll git on my hoss an' dodge away inter the hills.
If Siwash kin find me, then he's welcome ter take his
money back. Wonder if there's anythin' else in there?"</p>

<p>Again Pecos bent down, thrust his arm into the hole,
and drew out a suitcase, mouldy and stained. Pecos
weighed it in his hands, shook it, then cast it from him.</p>

<p>"Nothin' there!" he grumbled, and got to his feet.</p>

<p>A thrill shot through Matt. Pecos had seen Siwash
counting his money and putting it away in the secret
cache. Being a man of no principle, and believing that
he had been poorly paid, he had made up his mind to
steal all he could get his hands on and leave while Siwash
was away at Jessup's.</p>

<p>While he was handling the suitcase Matt had seen, on
one end of the mouldy piece of luggage, the letters,
"G. F."</p>

<p>There was no doubt but that Siwash Charley was Cant
Phillips! No doubt but that this satchel, drawn out of
the earthen cache by Pecos, was the dishonored officer's
luggage&mdash;the very receptacle which had contained the
San Francisco plans!</p>

<p>"Pecos!" cried Matt, as the thief darted toward the
door.</p>

<p>The man paused.</p>

<p>"I ain't got no time ter bother with you," he answered.</p>

<p>"You got me into this," begged Matt, "and why not
set me at liberty?"</p>

<p>"I'm takin' enough from Siwash, I reckon," said Pecos.</p>

<p>"But if it hadn't been for you I wouldn't be where I
am now."</p>

<p>"An' if ye wasn't where ye are now," answered Pecos,
by a strange process of reasoning, "I wouldn't be entitled
ter this!" He shook the jingling pouch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've got money in my pocket&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, ye have!" cried Pecos, with a complete change of
front. "That's diff'rent."</p>

<p>He pushed the pouch into the breast of his coat and
came to the side of the cot.</p>

<p>"I'll give it to you," said Matt, "provided you take the
ropes off my hands."</p>

<p>"Ye don't have ter give, my buck, so long as I kin take!
I'll not let ye go, but I'll take what ye got an' save Siwash
the trouble."</p>

<p>Matt's personal property had not been tampered with
by his captors&mdash;probably on orders issued by Murgatroyd,
who seemed to have his own ideas about how the
prisoner should be treated.</p>

<p>Pecos, in feverish haste, bent over Matt and tried to
get at his pockets. The tightly drawn coils of the rope
interfered. Swearing volubly, he grabbed up Siwash
Charley's knife from the table and hacked one of the coils
in half.</p>

<p>This cutting of one coil released all the others, and
Pecos was free to pursue his search unhindered. With a
grunt of exultation he drew a small roll of bills from
Matt's pocket, stuffed it into his trousers, and was away
like a shot.</p>

<p>Matt had the use of his feet, and, now that the coils
securing him to the cot had been severed, he was able to
rise to a sitting posture.</p>

<p>For a few moments his brain whirled dizzily. Just as
it began to resume its normal condition, a thump of galloping
hoofs sounded outside the door, and Matt struggled
erect and reeled to the opening.</p>

<p>Pecos Jones was putting his tired horse to its best
pace. Odd as it seemed to Matt, he was hurrying in the
direction of Sykestown.</p>

<p>Perhaps that was the best course for Pecos to take if
he wanted to avoid Siwash. He would not go into the
town, but could give it a wide berth, and make for
regions to the southward.</p>

<p>Weak and tortured with his numbed limbs, Matt sank
down on the earthen shelf.</p>

<p>Bound though he was, Matt knew he could escape.
Siwash, as yet, had not been gone half an hour. He
would certainly be back in an hour, full of wrath and
eager for revenge.</p>

<p>Matt did not believe that Murgatroyd had sent for
Siwash, but that Pecos had told the story simply to get
the other out of the way while the robbery was being
perpetrated. If this was true&mdash;and Matt felt positive
that it was&mdash;the fury of Siwash would pass all bounds.</p>

<p>It would be better for Matt not to be there when Siwash
returned, but there was Goff Fortescue's suit case.
Matt felt that he was in duty bound to take it with him,
and this he could not do unless he had the use of his
hands.</p>

<p>How was he to free himself? The knife lay on the
floor where Pecos had dropped it&mdash;and the knife suggested
possibilities.</p>

<p>Getting up from the shelf, he walked over to the knife
and knelt with it between his feet; then, with his numbed
fingers, he fumbled for the blade, lifted it upright, and
shoved his feet together with the knife between his heels,
edge side out.</p>

<p>This man&oelig;uvre took time, for Matt had to try again
and again, but at last the blade had a fairly rigid support,
with the handle between his heels and the back of
the knife against his body.</p>

<p>After resting a moment&mdash;for the work, so trifling in
the telling, had brought into torturing play every muscle&mdash;he
pushed the wrist cords up and down the sharp edge.
He cut himself slightly&mdash;it was impossible to avoid that&mdash;but
the cords were severed, and, with a groan of relief,
he drew his swollen hands around in front of him.</p>

<p>Almost fagged, he fell over upon the floor, feebly rubbing
his arms to restore circulation. While he was thus
engaged, the beat of hoofs, coming swiftly and the sound
rapidly growing in volume, reached him.</p>

<p>Siwash Charley! was the thought that darted through
his brain. It did not seem possible that the man had been
gone an hour.</p>

<p>It was too late, now, to leave the dugout, and Matt
got up and staggered to the door. For a moment he
stood there, looking. He was seen, and a furious yell
came echoing across the prairie. There was no doubt of
the approaching horseman being Siwash Charley.</p>

<p>The crack of a revolver was heard, and a bullet
thumped spitefully into the woodwork of the door frame.</p>

<p>Matt drew back, closed the door, and shoved the bolt.</p>

<p>Right then and there he and Siwash Charley would
have out their little differences. But Siwash was not the
only one of the two who was armed.</p>

<p>Matt remembered the rifle which belonged to Murgatroyd,
and to which Siwash had called Pecos Jones' attention.
Pecos, in his haste, had left without it, and Matt
now hurried to the corner and picked it up; then, returning
to the door, he crouched there and waited.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BESIEGED.</p>


<p>The king of the motor boys hated the very touch of a
firearm. He had seen so much wanton use of such
weapons when in the Southwest, that he had become imbued
with horror and disgust for anything that carried
powder and ball.</p>

<p>But here he was forced to fall back on whatever he
could find in order to withstand the attack of a frenzied
and desperate man.</p>

<p>Counting out the rage Siwash must feel over the trick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
that had taken him away from the dugout, if he once
broke into the room, found his money gone, and the
satchel in Matt's possession, there was no telling what
demons would be turned loose in him.</p>

<p>Having discovered the satchel, Matt was determined to
turn it over to Cameron. It was this resolve that had
held Matt to the spot, and now forced him to brave the
wrath of Siwash Charley.</p>

<p>Bang! bang! bang!</p>

<p>Leaden hail rattled on the door, but the door was of
stout plank and the metal could not penetrate it. The
barrier Siwash Charley had constructed for his own
preservation, in time of possible stress, now proved a
good shield for Motor Matt.</p>

<p>Having announced himself, in this violent fashion, Siwash
dismounted and tried the latch. The door, of
course, refused to yield, and Siwash hurled himself
against it. The stout planks trembled, and the earthen
wall quivered.</p>

<p>"Steady, there, Siwash Charley!" cried Matt. "I've
got Murgatroyd's rifle, and I don't intend to let you
come in here."</p>

<p>This announcement seemingly carried an effect. The
attack on the door ceased and Siwash began a parley.</p>

<p>"Did that coyote of a Pecos Jones set ye loose?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"How'n thunder did ye make it, then?"</p>

<p>"Pecos Jones robbed me&mdash;cut the ropes that tied me to
the cot so he could get at my pockets. You had left my
feet unbound, and I managed to juggle a bit with a knife
that lay on the floor."</p>

<p>"Waal, it won't do ye no good. Ye're in thar, an' I'm
out hyer, ye've got a rifle an' I've got a brace o' Colts,
an' on top o' that ye've got the use o' yer hands, but that
don't mean that ye're goin' ter git away. I ain't wantin'
ter harm ye&mdash;ye heerd what Murg said when he left&mdash;so
ye might as well open the door an' let me in."</p>

<p>"I'll not do that," answered Matt firmly.</p>

<p>"Why won't ye?"</p>

<p>"Because, now that I'm free, I'm going to stay that
way."</p>

<p>"Ye ain't free! All the freedom you got is ter run
eround that two-by-twice hole in the ground an' dodge
bullets. Whar's that coyote? I got a bone ter pick with
him."</p>

<p>"He's not here."</p>

<p>"I know that, kase I seen that his hoss wa'n't down by
the spring whar he picketed him. Whar'd he go?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"What did he play that bloomin' trick on me fer?
Murg wasn't at Jessup's&mdash;he an' the gal had been gone
from thar fer two hours."</p>

<p>Here was Matt's chance to laugh, but he was not in a
mood to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>"Do you remember counting your gold this morning,
Siwash?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>A startled exclamation broke from the ruffian.</p>

<p>"Did ye see that?" he returned. "I thought ye was
asleep."</p>

<p>"I wasn't the only one who saw it. Pecos Jones was
looking through the window. Pecos not only saw you
counting the money, but he also saw where you put it."</p>

<p>A bellow of fury broke from Siwash.</p>

<p>"Why didn't ye tell me he was at the winder?" he
fumed.</p>

<p>"Why should I?" returned Matt. "You fellows had
led me to believe that Pecos Jones' name was Hackberry,
and that he was a friend of mine. I had an idea that he
was coming here to rescue me, and that's the reason I
kept quiet."</p>

<p>Matt could hear Siwash tramping about and easing his
wrath as this shot went home.</p>

<p>"What did that coyote do?" roared Siwash. "Tell me
that."</p>

<p>"He took your money and ran away with it."</p>

<p>"Did&mdash;did he take anything else?"</p>

<p>"Well, some of my money that I had in a vest pocket."</p>

<p>"Anything else?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Ye know whar that cache is?"</p>

<p>"Of course. How could I help knowing when Pecos
Jones rifled it under my eyes?"</p>

<p>"I'm suspicionin' you," yelled Siwash, "with yer whistlin'
o' reveilles an' stable calls! Ye kain't fool me, not
fer a minit."</p>

<p>Matt had been afraid of this discovery, but there had
been no way of preventing it. He had told Siwash about
Pecos in the hope of having the ruffian trail away in pursuit
of the thief.</p>

<p>"Why don't you take after Pecos, Siwash?" asked
Matt.</p>

<p>"Kase it's wuth more ter me ter plant myself right hyer
an' look arter you. Open this door, 'r I open up on ye,
rifle or no rifle."</p>

<p>"I'll not open the door," answered Matt firmly, "and
if you try to break it down I'll send some bullets through
it. The planks can turn a revolver bullet, but a slug from
a rifle will go clean through the wood. Get away from
here, Siwash. Your cue is to take after Pecos Jones."</p>

<p>The words ended amid a crash of broken glass. Siwash
Charley was shooting through the window. Four
shots had already been fired. Matt counted three more.
These made seven, and five more shots would empty the
ruffian's revolvers.</p>

<p>If he had no more cartridges, he would be helpless.
But this was something on which Matt could not count
with certainty.</p>

<p>"Keep away from that window, Siwash!" cried Matt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
pressing close to the door. "Show yourself there and
I'll fire!"</p>

<p>Bang! bang! bang!</p>

<p>"Seven and three are ten," computed Matt. "He'll
soon have those weapons emptied. I don't believe he'll
show himself at the window, but perhaps I can coax him
to shoot again."</p>

<p>Dropping down on hands and knees, Matt crept to a
point directly under the window. Having reached this
spot, he placed his cap on the muzzle of the rifle and
lifted it.</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>"Eleven," thought Matt.</p>

<p>Then he gave a loud cry and allowed the cap to waver
back and forth.</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>"Twelve!" exulted Matt. "Now, if he hasn't any more
cartridges, I'll be safe."</p>

<p>Matt had allowed the cap to drop at the last shot. Outside
he could hear a tramp of running feet.</p>

<p>"I told the cub," came the voice of Siwash. "He ought
to've knowed better than ter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Siwash Charley's head was thrust in at the opening,
rimmed with its jagged points of glass. The scoundrel's
words died on his lips, for his eyes were blinking into
the muzzle of the rifle.</p>

<p>"Clear out, Siwash!" said Matt calmly. "I don't like
guns, and I don't like shooting, but I dislike your society
more than either one. Go away from here, and go
quick."</p>

<p>What Siwash said Matt could not hear, but he vanished
from the window as if by magic.</p>

<p>There was no more firing. In order to test his theory
regarding Siwash Charley's ammunition, Matt showed
himself boldly at the broken window.</p>

<p>The ruffian was not more than twenty feet away.
Quick as a flash he raised one of his weapons and pulled
the trigger. There was only a metallic click, which made
it manifest that Siwash had not kept such close track of
the ammunition as Motor Matt had done.</p>

<p>"Go away, I tell you," ordered the king of the motor
boys. "I've had enough trouble with you, and I intend
to get to Sykestown in time to prevent Murgatroyd from
carrying out his plans. If&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Matt paused, aghast. Across the prairie he could see
a swiftly moving blot&mdash;a motor car, he was sure, and
undoubtedly Murgatroyd's.</p>

<p>Siwash Charley was likewise looking at the approaching
car.</p>

<p>"Oh," he yelled, "I reckon ye ain't got everythin' your
way, arter all. Hyer comes Murg, an' ye kin bet Murg
ain't out o' ammunition even if I am!"</p>

<p>Matt's heart went down into his shoes. Wasn't luck
ever to turn for him? Was there to be no end to this
reverse which had come his way?</p>

<p>As he continued to gaze at the approaching car, it grew
plainer to his eyes. There was more than one man
aboard, he could see that, and the car didn't look like
Murgatroyd's, but of a different color. This car was
brown!</p>

<p>As Matt's hopes arose, Siwash Charley's began to
sink. A moment later, Siwash rushed for his horse.</p>

<p>"Cameron!" cried Matt, hardly able to believe his eyes;
"Cameron and McGlory!"</p>

<p>Turning from the window he ran to the door, flung it
open and leaped outside.</p>

<p>Yells came from the car, and some one stood up in
front and waved his hat wildly.</p>

<p>Matt, pointing to the fleeing Siwash, shouted at the
top of his voice:</p>

<p>"Capture that man, Cameron! He's Phillips, the deserter!
He is armed, but his revolvers are empty! Capture
him!"</p>

<p>If Matt's words were not heard or understood, at least
his gestures were. The car turned and darted after Siwash
Charley.</p>

<p>The king of the motor boys, leaning against the front
wall of the dugout, watched the race.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE BROKER'S GAME.</p>


<p>The remarks of the landlord, in front of the hotel, had
given McGlory and Cameron a clue of which they were
not slow to take advantage.</p>

<p>Here was Motor Matt's enemy, the very man who had
set in motion the plot which, through Hackberry, had
lured the king of the motor boys into Wells County on a
useless quest.</p>

<p>Coolly enough Murgatroyd brought his car to a stop in
front of the hotel and faced the angry lieutenant and
cowboy.</p>

<p>"Your name Murgatroyd?" demanded Cameron.</p>

<p>"My name, yes, sir," answered the broker, half turning
in his seat so as to command a better view of the lieutenant.
"But," he added quietly, "I believe that you have
the advantage of me."</p>

<p>"Cameron's my name."</p>

<p>"Ah!" A flash crossed Murgatroyd's face. "I might
have known who you were, just by seeing you with
McGlory there. This is a fortunate meeting."</p>

<p>"Fortunate!" cried McGlory, dancing around the front
of the car. "Speak to me about that! I should say it
was fortunate, you old tinhorn&mdash;for us, if not for you.
What's this game you've put up on Motor Matt?"</p>

<p>"If we do any talking," said the broker mildly, "you'll
have to express yourself in terms that I can understand."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'll savvy a heap before we're done with you."</p>

<p>"Just a minute," went on Murgatroyd. "My niece is
in the car with me, and I think it well that she should not
listen to your violent talk." He looked around. "Amy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl was white, but she made no attempt to get
out of the tonneau.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to leave, Uncle Amos," said she. "I
want to hear more of this talk."</p>

<p>"You will please obey me, Amy, and leave the car."</p>

<p>"It is your car," she answered, "and I haven't any
right to stay in it if you don't want me to."</p>

<p>Cameron opened the door for her and held out his hand
to help her down. She paid no attention to the extended
hand, but passed into the hotel.</p>

<p>"Before we begin," proceeded Murgatroyd, "let me ask
you if you recognize this watch."</p>

<p>He offered the timepiece as he finished.</p>

<p>"It's Matt's!" exclaimed McGlory, snatching the watch.</p>

<p>"Him Motol Matt's clock, allee light," breathed Ping.
The hotel proprietor was the only person, besides Cameron,
McGlory, and Ping, within reach of the broker's
words.</p>

<p>"This conversation is of a private nature, Brackett,"
said Murgatroyd significantly, "even though it is taking
place in the street in front of your hotel."</p>

<p>Brackett excused himself and passed around the corner
of the building.</p>

<p>"That watch," proceeded the broker, "will prove to you
that your friend is in my hands. He is being kept safely
in a place which you will not be able to find. I have written
three letters, one to you, Lieutenant Cameron, one to
McGlory, and one to Mrs. Traquair. It will not be necessary
to post two of them, for I can tell you, face to face,
what the letters contain.</p>

<p>"The one to you, Cameron, has to do with some little
unpleasantness connected with the aëroplane trials recently
held at Fort Totten. Siwash Charley and, through
him, myself were wrongly suspected of complicity in an
accident connected with the flying machine. This has
been very annoying to me. Your letter contained the information
that, other matters being satisfactorily adjusted,
your friend Motor Matt would be released under
written promise from the authorities at Fort Totten to
give over persecuting me and Siwash Charley for a crime
of which we are entirely innocent."</p>

<p>McGlory, to put it figuratively, immediately "went up
in the air." Before he could air his views, however,
Cameron silenced him with a look.</p>

<p>"Motor Matt, according to your proposition, as I understand
it," returned the lieutenant calmly, "is to be released
providing the military authorities promise you and
Siwash Charley immunity?"</p>

<p>"That is one of the conditions governing the release,"
answered Murgatroyd.</p>

<p>"What are the other conditions?"</p>

<p>"Well, the letter to McGlory contained that. Mrs.
Traquair, as satisfaction for the mortgage which I hold
against the Traquair homestead, west of here, is to turn
over the quarter section to me. That is all. My letter to
Mrs. Traquair contains that proposition, and my letter to
McGlory requests him to write Mrs. Traquair that what
I say, regarding the capture of Motor Matt, is true. McGlory
is also to advise her to accept my terms. If those
terms are accepted, and if the authorities at Fort Totten
agree not to persecute me, or Siwash Charley, any further,
Motor Matt will be released."</p>

<p>The cowboy was so full of language that he could
hardly restrain himself. Cameron laid a hand on his
arm and pushed him away.</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd," said the lieutenant, "you have just made
the most impudent and brazen proposition I ever heard.
You deliberately plan and commit a crime, and then plan
and commit another to save you from legal responsibility
for both."</p>

<p>"You look at it in a prejudiced way," returned the
broker, apparently not in the least ruffled. "What is your
answer?"</p>

<p>The lieutenant was thoughtful for a space.</p>

<p>"I have no power to promise you immunity," said he.</p>

<p>"You will take it up with your superior officer at Fort
Totten?"</p>

<p>"I won't say that, but I will say that I will think it
over."</p>

<p>"That is all I can ask. How about you, McGlory?"</p>

<p>"Sufferin' wildcats!" gurgled McGlory. "Have I got
to answer that? Have I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He'll think it over, Murgatroyd," broke in Cameron,
"just as I intend doing. Where is Motor Matt?"</p>

<p>"That is my secret," and the wily broker actually
smiled.</p>

<p>"Is he far from here?"</p>

<p>"Another secret. While you are thinking the matter
over, I will hunt for a place to stow my car."</p>

<p>He got out to use the crank, and Cameron caught McGlory's
arm and led him into the hotel.</p>

<p>"Why didn't I hit him?" the cowboy was murmuring
dazedly. "Why didn't you let me hit him, Cameron, or
else hit him yourself?"</p>

<p>"Because, McGlory, we've got to talk this over and&mdash;&mdash; Ah!"
The lieutenant broke off as a slender form
swept toward him across the office. "This is the young
lady, I believe, who was in the car with Mr. Murgatroyd?"</p>

<p>The girl was still pale, but there was resolution in her
face and manner.</p>

<p>"I have not much time to talk," said she, "for what I
say must be said before my uncle comes in. Mr. Murgatroyd
is my uncle. I am a school teacher and live in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Fargo with my mother. For some time I have been in
poor health, and Mr. Murgatroyd suggested that I take
an automobile trip with him through this part of the
country, where he was coming to look up some of his investments.
For a few days our headquarters have been
here. Yesterday afternoon we were riding to the north
and west of Sykestown when an aëroplane came sailing
toward us, dropped down close to the automobile, and a
young man whom I afterward learned was Motor Matt
hailed my uncle and asked him some question. When
my uncle answered, Motor Matt seemed to recognize him,
and tried to turn the air ship away. My uncle had a rifle
near him, and he fired at the aëroplane, injuring the machinery
so that it fell and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"No," the girl broke off, seeing the look of alarm that
crossed the faces of her auditors. "Motor Matt was not
seriously injured, but the aëroplane was damaged. This
happened about ten miles out, on the road to Jessup's.
My uncle turned around and took me to Jessup's, where
he left me. I am very sure that he then went some place,
secured Siwash Charley to help him, and made a prisoner
of Motor Matt. I do not know where your friend was
taken, but it could not have been a great way from
Jessup's home&mdash;west of the road, I think, and along the
base of the hills, for that is the way my uncle came when
he returned to the farmhouse. We stayed at Jessup's
all night and came here this morning. On the way, we
passed the aëroplane, and my uncle got out, looked the
machine over, and came back with that watch.</p>

<p>"That is all I can tell you. Do not try to keep me any
longer, or to ask me any questions. I shall go back to
Fargo by train, for I do not like the way my uncle is doing.
I&mdash;I hope that you will find your friend and that&mdash;that
no harm has happened to him."</p>

<p>The girl had spoken rapidly, and with nervous impatience,
continually watching the door. When she finished,
she turned away and passed hastily up the stairs leading
to the second floor.</p>

<p>The amazing news she had given held McGlory, Cameron,
and Ping spellbound. While they stood, gazing at
each other, Murgatroyd entered the office.</p>

<p>"As soon as you have come to a decision," said he, "let
me know."</p>

<p>Then he, too, passed up the stairs.</p>

<p>Cameron was the first of the three to recover his wits.</p>

<p>"Quick!" said he, catching McGlory's arm, "there's no
time to be lost. Run over to the railroad station and
send a telegram to Mrs. Traquair, McGlory. Tell her to
pay no attention to any letter she may receive from Murgatroyd.
While you're doing that, I'll get out the car
and we'll make a run out on the road to Jessup's."</p>

<p>McGlory, inspired with the necessity for rapid work,
hustled for the telegraph office. Cameron hurried to the
shed after the car. While he was getting the machine
ready, Ping mysteriously disappeared.</p>

<p>As the lieutenant pulled out of the shed, he looked for
the cowboy and the Chinaman. Neither was in sight.</p>

<p>Two minutes later McGlory appeared, and crossed
from the railroad station to the car on a run.</p>

<p>"Where's Ping?" demanded Cameron.</p>

<p>"That's too many for me," said McGlory. "I thought
he was with you."</p>

<p>"And I had the idea that he had gone with you. Well,
we can't wait for him," and Cameron drove the car
around to the front of the hotel.</p>

<p>A man was crossing the street. Cameron hailed him.</p>

<p>"Which is the road to Jessup's?" he asked.</p>

<p>The man pointed it out. Barely had he given the directions
when Murgatroyd ran out of the hotel and vanished
around the corner of the building.</p>

<p>"He's after his car!" murmured McGlory.</p>

<p>Some one jumped to the footboard and scrambled into
the tonneau just as Cameron threw in the switch. It
was Ping. He was breathing hard, and his yellow face
was as near white as it could possibly be.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, Ping?" asked McGlory.</p>

<p>The Chinaman held up one hand. As the flowing
sleeve fell away his yellow fingers could be seen gripping
a switch plug.</p>

<p>"Murg forgettee plug," chattered Ping. "My findee
car, takee plug&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cameron let off a shout as he coaxed the automobile
into a faster pace.</p>

<p>"That knocks out Murgatroyd, so far as chasing us is
concerned," said he. "Shake hands with the chink for
me, McGlory. I'm too all-fired busy."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">CANT PHILLIPS, DESERTER.</p>


<p>The car slammed its way across the bridge over the
Pipestem and hustled at a fifty-mile-an-hour clip in the
direction of Jessup's.</p>

<p>"There's a schoolma'm that's worth her weight gold
bullion," remarked McGlory. "Her uncle must have
found out that she told us something, or he wouldn't
have scattered after his car like he did."</p>

<p>"Much good it will do him now," chuckled Cameron,
"since Ping has robbed the machine of the important
plug. For once the broker was careless."</p>

<p>"And to think of him putting a bullet into the aëroplane
and bringing it down!" said McGlory through his
teeth. "I reckon that spoils the sale to the government."</p>

<p>"It may," returned Cameron, "but all I can say is I'm
sorry if it does."</p>

<p>"How we're to find Matt is a conundrum," went on
the cowboy. "Turn west from the road to Jessup's and
follow the hills. That may be all right, and it may not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Sufferin' horned toads, but all this is gettin' on my
nerves."</p>

<p>"Siwash Charley is taking care of Matt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Taking care of him! I can imagine how the tinhorn
is doing that. I hope Pard Matt is able to stand it."</p>

<p>Ten miles were covered in short order, and those in
the flying car had a glimpse of the aëroplane beside the
road.</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem to be hurt much," remarked Cameron.</p>

<p>"It must be damaged considerable, for all that," said
the cowboy. "If it hadn't been, Matt would have got
away before Murgatroyd could take the girl to Jessup's,
pick up Siwash, and then come back and lay him by the
heels."</p>

<p>Cameron brought the car to a halt, jamming down on
both brakes.</p>

<p>"Ping," said he, "go back and watch the aëroplane.
Here's a revolver. Don't let any one tamper with the
machine. We'll be along after a while."</p>

<p>Ping was accustomed to obey orders. Without a word
he took the weapon Cameron handed to him and got out
of the car. The lieutenant threw in the switch and away
they went again.</p>

<p>"There's the hills," announced McGlory, after a period
of speeding, pointing to the misty blue line of uplifts.</p>

<p>"I believe I'll break from the trail and head straight
for them," said Cameron.</p>

<p>"Might as well," assented McGlory. "It's all a guess,
anyhow, and that move is as likely to be right as any
other we can make."</p>

<p>There were broad marks of automobile tires in the
dust. Cameron had been watching them. Although he
said nothing about it to the cowboy, yet he turned from
the road at a point where another car had made the turn.</p>

<p>Straight for the hills the lieutenant headed, and as
they came closer, McGlory suddenly dropped a hand on
Cameron's arm.</p>

<p>"Do you hear it?" asked the cowboy excitedly.</p>

<p>"Hear what?"</p>

<p>"Firing. There it goes again."</p>

<p>Cameron heard it, but it was very faint.</p>

<p>"That sounds as though we were going to get next to
something," said McGlory.</p>

<p>"And looks like it, too. Isn't that a horse I see against
the background of a hill, over there?"</p>

<p>The cowboy looked straight ahead.</p>

<p>"You're right!" he cried. "There's a horse there, and
a man farther along. The man's shooting at the face of
the uplift. There! Hear that, Cameron? What's he
wasting ammunition like that for?"</p>

<p>Cameron did not answer; he was busy looking and
listening and running the car.</p>

<p>"Thunder!" exclaimed McGlory, as the scene opened
clearer and clearer before his eyes, "there's a hole in the
hillside&mdash;two holes, or I'm a Piute, for another just
opened up."</p>

<p>"And the man's mounting the horse," said Cameron.</p>

<p>"And some one is coming through that hole in the
hill. Sufferin' surprises! Why, it's Matt! Look, Cameron!
He's pointing toward the man, and saying something.
I can't hear what he says, but it's a cinch he
wants us to follow the man."</p>

<p>"And it's a cinch we'll do it, too!" cried Cameron.
"Pull that other revolver out of my hip pocket, McGlory.
Don't use it, though, till I tell you to. The bare sight of
it may be enough to bring the man to a halt."</p>

<p>Cameron had turned the car and was plunging across
the prairie in hot pursuit of the fleeing horseman. The
car was going five feet to the horse's one, and the pursuit
was drawing to a rapid close.</p>

<p>"It's Siwash Charley!" announced McGlory.</p>

<p>"I'd about made up my mind to that," said Cameron.
"He was shooting at Matt. It looks as though we had
arrived just in time, McGlory."</p>

<p>As the car leaped and swayed across the prairie, the
cowboy stood up, hanging to Cameron with one hand
and waving the revolver with the other.</p>

<p>"Halt!" he shouted.</p>

<p>Siwash Charley turned in his saddle and shook his fist
defiantly.</p>

<p>"He's going to fight," said Cameron. "Look out for
a shot when we come close. But don't fire yet, McGlory."</p>

<p>"What's the use of waiting?" demurred the cowboy.
"It's a wonder Siwash hasn't opened up on us before
now."</p>

<p>"We'll run him down in a minute. His horse&mdash;&mdash; Ah,
ha! See that."</p>

<p>Siwash had been giving rather too much attention to
the pursuing car and too little to his horse. The animal
dropped a foot in a gopher hole and turned a somersault
on the dried grass. Siwash shot out of the saddle as
though he had been fired from a cannon, caromed across
the prairie, and then lay still.</p>

<p>Cameron nearly ran over the scoundrel before he could
shut off and clamp on the brakes. The horse, escaping a
broken leg by almost a miracle, scrambled to its feet,
gave a frightened snort, and dashed on at full speed, stirrups
flying.</p>

<p>"Never mind the horse," said Cameron. "Let Jessup
have the brute. Siwash is the one we're after."</p>

<p>"He's coming easy," returned McGlory, dropping the
revolver on the seat and following the lieutenant out of
the car.</p>

<p>Siwash was lying silent and motionless on the ground.
Cameron knelt beside him and laid a hand on his breast.</p>

<p>"Is he done for?" asked McGlory.</p>

<p>Cameron shook his head.</p>

<p>"Stunned, that's all. If we had a rope&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"The only thing we've got in the way of a line is the
piece of string Ping tied around our lunch bag," broke
in McGlory, picking the weapons out of Siwash Charley's
pockets. "These are no good," he added, after a
brief examination. "Every cartridge has been used.
Let's load Siwash into the tonneau, Cameron, and I'll
agree to keep him quiet until we can get to where Matt
is waiting for us."</p>

<p>Between them Cameron and McGlory lifted the huge
bulk of the unconscious ruffian and deposited him, none
too gently, in the rear of the car. The cowboy climbed
in beside him, and the lieutenant cranked up, took his
seat, and started back along the foot of the hills. Matt
greeted them cheerily as they drew up at the door of the
dugout.</p>

<p>"How are you, pard?" whooped McGlory.</p>

<p>"Bruised a little and mighty hungry, but otherwise all
right. How's Siwash?"</p>

<p>"In need of a rope, Matt," said Cameron. "Have you
got one handy?"</p>

<p>Matt ran into the dugout and picked up part of the
rope that had been used to secure him to the chair and
the cot. With this Cameron and McGlory made Siwash
Charley secure before his wits returned, thus avoiding a
possible struggle.</p>

<p>As soon as this part of the work was finished, the cowboy
sprang from the car and gripped Motor Matt by the
hand.</p>

<p>"You've had a rough time, pard," said he, "and something
of a reverse, if what we've learned is true, but
you're stacking up pretty well for all that. What sort of
a place is this, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"It's Phillips' old rendezvous," said Matt.</p>

<p>"Phillips?" echoed Cameron. "Do you mean Siwash
Charley, Matt?"</p>

<p>"No one else."</p>

<p>"Have you any proof of it?"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute."</p>

<p>Matt ran into the dugout and presently reappeared
with the suit case.</p>

<p>"Chance threw that in my way," said he, "and, by trying
to save it for you, Cameron, I very nearly got myself
into more trouble than I could manage. Look at these
initials." Matt pointed to the letters "G. F." on the end
of the stained and mouldy grip. "This must be the very
satchel, don't you think," he added, "that the drummer
received by mistake, over in Devil's Lake City?"</p>

<p>Cameron was so amazed he could not speak. Taking
the suit case from Matt, he opened it up on the ground.
It was not locked and opened readily.</p>

<p>There were stained and mouldy documents inside&mdash;blue-prints,
tracings, and pages of memoranda.</p>

<p>Cameron rose erect and stared down at the satchel's
disordered contents.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt about it," he muttered. "This is
the identical suit case that Captain Fortescue carried
across the lake with him that day it was supposed he
started for St. Paul, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A call came from the wagon.</p>

<p>"What you fellers roughin' things up with me fer?
Murgatroyd has got somethin' ter say ter you. When
you hear that you'll be lettin' me go."</p>

<p>"He's still hazy," said Matt. "He doesn't remember
what's happened."</p>

<p>They all stepped to the side of the car and looked
down at Siwash Charley where he lay helpless on the
tonneau seat.</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd," said Cameron sternly, "has already told
us what he had to say."</p>

<p>"Ye kain't do nothin' ter me fer takin' keer o' Motor
Matt," rambled Siwash Charley. "I treated him white,
an' he'll tell ye the same thing."</p>

<p>"That's not what we've captured you for," went on
Cameron. "You're a deserter, and your name isn't Siwash
Charley, but Cant Phillips. You're for Totten, my
man, and a court-martial that will probably land you
where you won't be able to break the law for a long time
to come."</p>

<p>Then, for the first time since his senses had returned,
Siwash Charley appeared to understand all that his capture
meant.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE LOSING CAUSE.</p>


<p>Murgatroyd must have had an extra switch plug with
him, for Brackett, proprietor of the hotel, was authority
for the assertion that he left town shortly after Cameron,
McGlory, and Ping had taken their departure. Murgatroyd,
however, went east, while the other car took a
western trail.</p>

<p>What became of Murgatroyd was for some time a
mystery. He was not met along the road between Sykestown
and Carrington, and he was not seen in the latter
town.</p>

<p>His niece likewise vanished, taking the train&mdash;this,
also, on the authority of Brackett&mdash;and presumably returning
to Fargo. For her, Motor Matt and his friends
always thereafter treasured a warm regard. She had
turned resolutely against a relative in order to make sure
that right and justice were meted out to a stranger.</p>

<p>Cant Phillips, alias Siwash Charley, was removed to
Fort Totten. After a trial, during which it could not be
proved that he had lost the dagger which Ping had
found in the woods, or that he had met Captain Fortescue
by agreement or otherwise and dealt foully with him, or
that he had stolen the suit case and the plans, he was sent
to the government prison at Leavenworth to serve a long
term.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Phillips' story was to the effect that he had deserted to
go into the "business" of stealing horses with Pecos
Jones, and that the suit case and the plans were in Jones'
possession when he&mdash;Phillips&mdash;joined him.</p>

<p>But Phillips could not deny his identity, nor the evident
fact that he was a deserter. For this he received a
sentence that was the limit for desertion, lengthened
somewhat by the belief of those presiding at his trial that
he had at least a guilty knowledge of the other crimes
imputed to him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Traquair was very much wrought up when she
discovered how Murgatroyd, using her name, had beguiled
the king of the motor boys into a trap destined
to free the broker and Siwash Charley of "persecution"
by the military authorities, and, at the same time, to secure
for the broker himself the Traquair homestead.</p>

<p>It was an audacious plan, and a foolish one, but the
several steps by which it was worked were covered in
rather a masterly way.</p>

<p>Mrs. Traquair had departed suddenly for a visit with
friends in Fargo. Learning of this, and from this one
insignificant fact alone, Murgatroyd had built up the
whole fabric of his plot. It was a losing cause, and Matt
had been caught in it, for, if the audacious scheme was
to be successful, the king of the motor boys would be
the one factor that made it so. Everything hinged on
him.</p>

<p>The aëroplane was guarded by Ping until Matt, Cameron,
and McGlory reached Sykestown over the trail to
Jessup's and sent a team and wagon back to bring the
damaged machine into town. The same wagon that
hauled it into Sykestown likewise hauled it across country
and back to Fort Totten.</p>

<p>Matt, McGlory, and Cameron, before leaving the dugout
to return to Sykestown with their prisoner, lingered
to talk over recent events, hear each other's account of
what had happened, and to make a further examination
of the earthen room.</p>

<p>Nothing of any importance was found, save a slender
supply of food in the box cupboard, which was promptly
confiscated. When the friends left, they closed the door,
allowed the painted screens to fall into place over the
door and the broken window, and then marked with
astonishment how, at a little distance, even they were at
a loss to mark the particular place of that lawless retreat.</p>

<p>"It's a regular robbers' roost," declared McGlory, looking
back as the car carried them toward the road.</p>

<p>"It ought to be destroyed," said Cameron. "A knowledge
of its presence is an invitation for some other lawless
men to make use of it."</p>

<p>"Pecos Jones, for example," added McGlory. "How
much money did that fellow get from you, Matt?"</p>

<p>"Twelve dollars," answered Matt. "If he hadn't been
in such a hurry, he might have found my money belt
and secured three hundred more."</p>

<p>"You got off easy," said Cameron.</p>

<p>"Not so easy, after all, lieutenant. I wouldn't go
through that set-to with Siwash Charley again for all the
gold that was ever minted. I don't like guns, anyway."</p>

<p>"Somethin' queer about that, too," observed McGlory.
"Explosive engines are Matt's hobby, but set off an explosion
in a steel tube, with a piece o' lead in front o' it,
an' he shies clear off the road."</p>

<p>The next day, after the aëroplane had been brought in
and sent on to Fort Totten, and the boys had learned
various things from Brackett concerning Murgatroyd and
his niece, the little party moved on toward Devil's Lake
in the car, taking Cant Phillips with them.</p>

<p>When the post was reached there was a disagreeable
surprise awaiting Matt. It came in the shape of a telegram
from headquarters, announcing that the trials at
Fort Myer had been indefinitely postponed, and that,
therefore, another of the Traquair aëroplanes would not
be needed.</p>

<p>"Bang goes fifteen thousand!" mourned McGlory.</p>

<p>"The department may change its mind," suggested
Cameron, "when it hears about that straight-away flight
of the aëroplane into Wells County."</p>

<p>"While the war department is changing its mind," said
Matt, smothering his disappointment with a laugh, "McGlory
and I will get busy putting the aëroplane into
shape and then look for fresh fields and pastures new."</p>

<p>"That hits me, pard," said McGlory. "I've been pining
for a change of scene, but I hate to leave this vicinity
while Murgatroyd is at large."</p>

<p>"Forget Murgatroyd, Joe," counseled Matt.</p>

<p>"If he'll forget us, yes, but I don't think he will."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DOCTORS_RUSE" id="THE_DOCTORS_RUSE">THE DOCTOR'S RUSE.</a></h2>


<p>One morning in September, 190-, there came to the office
of Doctor Frederic Curtin, a young English physician in
Hongkong, a native junkman from the Chinese city of
Swatow, about two hundred miles northeast of the English
city. The junkman brought a letter to the doctor from
an old acquaintance, the Rev. James Burren, a missionary
in the vicinity of Swatow; and the letter begged Curtin to
come and attend the missionary's young son, who was suffering
from a puzzling and lingering illness.</p>

<p>As none of his patients in Hongkong demanded his immediate
attention, Curtin was free to respond to the call.
The <i>Silver Moon</i>, the trading junk that had brought the letter
of appeal, was to leave on the return voyage the next day
at noon; and as this junk offered the only means of reaching
Swatow for several days, Curtin engaged passage on the
slow-sailing, clumsy vessel.</p>

<p>There had been much activity that summer among the
native pirates that infest the coast waters of the China Sea;
and although the doctor did not expect to encounter any of
these gentry, he took the precaution of placing in his valise
two heavy navy revolvers and a quantity of cartridges.</p>

<p>The <i>Silver Moon</i> sailed on the morrow at midday, as
scheduled, and, driven by a wide spread of canvas, slipped
through the deep-blue, lapping water of this Eastern sea at
a much better speed than the doctor expected. That evening
a nearly full moon floated in the clear sky, and gave a glory
to the ocean that Curtin had never seen surpassed. He sat
on deck until late, and when he did go down to his cramped
berth in the cabin below, he dropped into a sleep so profound
that his first intimation of danger was when he was
awakened by fierce, wild cries and the scurrying and trampling
of many feet on the deck overhead.</p>

<p>He sprang to get his revolvers. But while he fumbled
with the catches of the case, there was a rush of footsteps
down the passageway outside; and the next moment the
frail door burst in with a crash before the attack of half a
dozen nearly naked Chinamen, who had revolvers and short
curved swords. The <i>Silver Moon</i> had fallen a prey to pirates,
and Curtin calmly submitted himself to the invaders.</p>

<p>He was allowed to dress. In the meantime the pirates
rummaged through his baggage, including the rather portly
black leather case in which he carried his medicines and
surgical instruments. When he was hustled on deck a few
moments later he found lying alongside the <i>Silver Moon</i> a
huge junk, and swarming over the captured vessel a motley
horde of evil-looking barbarians.</p>

<p>The crew of the <i>Silver Moon</i>, awed and cringing, was huddled
forward under guard.</p>

<p>But Curtin was not placed with the other captives. At a
word from the thin, wiry man who appeared to be the
leader, two of the pirates marched the doctor straight
aboard the strange junk, where they proceeded to bind his
arms and legs with ropes, and left him near the foremast,
to sprawl or sit on the hard deck, as he chose.</p>

<p>Then as soon as everything of value on the <i>Silver Moon</i>
had been transferred to the robber junk, the crew returned
to their own vessel, and cast off, leaving their countrymen
to go their way in peace. The pirate junk now headed to
the northeast, following the coast.</p>

<p>Curtin, sprawling on the bare deck in his bonds, could
only conjecture what was to be his fate. He knew that the
native pirates often made a practice of holding prisoners for
ransom, and he fancied that his captors intended to do so
in his case, otherwise they would not have singled him out
from all those on the captured junk. It did not reassure
him to reflect that his bank account in Hongkong was an
extremely modest one, and that he had few friends in the
city who could place any large sum at his disposal.</p>

<p>About the middle of the forenoon his attention was attracted
to one of the pirate crew&mdash;a big man who was restlessly
pacing up and down the sun-scorched deck not far
away, apparently in intense agony. On observing the fellow
closely, the doctor saw that there was an angry, unhealed
wound in the muscles of his bare left forearm, and
noted that the arm itself was swollen to nearly twice its normal
size.</p>

<p>At once Curtin's professional instinct was stirred. On the
impulse of the moment he stood up awkwardly on his pinioned
legs, and said in Chinese:</p>

<p>"That is a bad wound you have in your arm. I am an
English doctor of Hongkong. Perhaps if you will let me
see your arm I can relieve the pain."</p>

<p>The big Chinaman stopped his uneasy striding to stand
and look doubtfully at the speaker. The pirate leader happened
to be near, heard what Curtin said, and, the wounded
sailor continuing to hesitate, signed him to allow the doctor
to examine his arm.</p>

<p>The sufferer obeyed stolidly, and one glance at the inflamed
wound, which evidently had been made by a sword
thrust, was enough to tell Curtin that he had to deal with a
case of threatened blood poisoning. But he thought that if
the arm was immediately lanced the Chinaman would have
a good chance for speedy recovery.</p>

<p>This he told the pirate captain, who had come over to
stand beside his fellow cutthroat. He said that if the black
case that had been seized among his other baggage that
morning was brought and his arms were released, he would
at once treat the wound, although he would not guarantee to
cure the man.</p>

<p>To the doctor's surprise, the captain answered that he
had lived in Hongkong, and knew of the skill of the English
doctors, and that he would be much gratified if Curtin
could save the sailor, as the fellow was one of his best men.</p>

<p>The medicine case was quickly produced, and the doctor's
hands were untied. First ascertaining that the contents of
the case were undisturbed, he prepared the wounded arm by
pouring a little alcohol upon it. Then he took out his instruments
and quickly performed the operation.</p>

<p>The look of relief that came into the sufferer's face was
apparent, but neither the captain nor the other members of the
pirate crew, who had gathered round to watch, made any comment.
Curtin carefully dressed and bandaged the wound,
and as soon as he had finished, his hands were rebound. His
patient moved away without a word of thanks or appreciation,
yet the doctor did not neglect to say that as often as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
was necessary he would attend the arm again. He was
anxious to make a friend of this Chinaman; for a friend, he
felt, would not be a bad thing to have among that barbarous
crew.</p>

<p>Shortly after sunset that evening the junk reached the
mouth of a narrow river, and a quarter of a mile from the
entrance to this stream the sails were lowered and anchor
was dropped. Curtin gathered from the talk of some of the
crew who stood near him that the junk was to be taken up
this river to an outlaw retreat, but that they would not enter
the narrow channel until the high tide of the next morning.</p>

<p>Not long after the evening meal was over the pirates began
to turn in for the night. Most of them merely threw
themselves down on the hard deck. By nine o'clock all were
asleep, with the exception of a single watchman, whom Curtin
could see strolling back and forth across the afterdeck.</p>

<p>Hours passed, and as the doctor lay outstretched on the
bare deck, he tried to work his hands out of the hempen cord
that bound them together behind his back. He thought that
if he could free himself from his bonds, the watchman might
nap, and thus give him opportunity to slip over the side of
the vessel into the sea and swim ashore. But he was unable
to release his hands.</p>

<p>Not long after this, the watchman came forward and silently
passed close to Curtin, and he was rather surprised to
see that the lone guard was no other than the man whose
arm he had lanced that morning. He wondered idly if the
fellow had been chosen for the post of watchman for the
reason that suffering had rendered him sleepless.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, as he looked up at the big yellow man, a
new idea for escape germinated, grew to a hazy outline, and
in a moment took definite shape in Curtin's mind.</p>

<p>In his medicine case was a vial containing a quantity of a
certain very powerful anæsthetic. He had told the pirate
that he would dress the wound again when necessary. If
on this excuse he could get his hands freed and the case in
his possession, why would it not be easy to administer a few
drops of the drug by a hypodermic injection, and almost immediately
send the watchman into a coma that would last for
hours&mdash;render him unconscious before he could rebind his
captive's hands or think to make outcry?</p>

<p>Curtin fully realized the danger attendant upon so audacious
a scheme. But he felt that as long as he was in the
hands of these ruthless and merciless men his life was not
safe from one hour to the next.</p>

<p>Immediately he hailed the watchman and asked him about
his arm. The tall pirate paused and replied that it still pained
him considerably. Curtin suggested that he should bring the
medicine case and have his arm treated there in the bright
moonlight.</p>

<p>The watchman was slow in answering. Curtin began to
think that the natural craftiness of his race had counseled
him against the proposition, when with a gesture of consent
he went to the companionway and disappeared. In a few
moments he came back, carrying the familiar case in his
hand. Then the doctor's heart gave a joyous leap.</p>

<p>As soon as his hands were loosened, he quickly opened the
case and took out the vial he needed and the hypodermic
syringe. He poured into the syringe a few drops of the
colorless fluid from the vial. Next, with hands that trembled
with eagerness, he unwound the bandage from the
wounded arm.</p>

<p>Curtin picked up the syringe nonchalantly, but it gave him
a shock to note at this instant that the huge pirate had his
right hand resting on the carved hilt of the short, naked
sword slipped through his belt.</p>

<p>However, the doctor did not hesitate. He resolutely
grasped the proffered arm, and carefully inserted the needle
point of the instrument into the flesh so far above the wound
that the powerful drug could have but little harmful effect
upon the irritated region. Then, with even pressure upon
the plunger, he completely emptied the vial.</p>

<p>He withdrew the syringe, and keeping a strong grip upon
his victim's arm, began to replace the bandage.</p>

<p>He worked slowly, methodically, occupying as much time
as possible in each step of the operation. The Chinaman
soon began to show signs of a strange, unnatural drowsiness.
His head nodded on his broad shoulders, his eyes were
half closed, and he opened them with difficulty. All at once
the doctor's vigilant eye saw a startled, apprehensive look
flit across the countenance of the pirate. The next instant
the man gave a half-inarticulate cry and snatched out his
sword.</p>

<p>Curtin threw up his hand to arrest the fall of the blade,
but suddenly, in the twinkling of an eye, the Chinaman wavered,
the uplifted arm dropped nerveless, the sword fell clattering
to the deck from the grasp of the relaxed fingers. As
the watchman toppled over under the influence of the drug,
the doctor caught him in his arms and lowered him to the
deck.</p>

<p>Then Curtin snatched up the sword, and, with one slash of
the keen blade, severed the ropes that bound his ankles
loosely together. He listened just a moment. All was still
on the junk. He stooped down and finished adjusting the
bandage to the senseless outlaw's wounded arm.</p>

<p>But he did not linger long on the pirate craft. Throwing
a rope over the side of the junk, he slid down into the water
and swam away.</p>

<p>No mishap occurred to him in the water, and soon he was
following the sands of the beach to the northeast.</p>

<p>At daybreak he came upon a British gunboat lying a little
way off the shore, and in response to his signals, a boat put
out and took him aboard. That evening he was landed in
Swatow. He found the missionary's son very ill with a
stubborn fever; but Curtin took up the battle just in time,
and at the end of a week had the satisfaction of witnessing
the boy's recovery.</p>

<h2><a name="STRANDED_ON_A_CHIMNEY" id="STRANDED_ON_A_CHIMNEY">STRANDED ON A CHIMNEY.</a></h2>


<p>"Unravel your stocking, John; begin at the toe," was a
sentence which many an old-time schoolboy learned well,
for it appeared in the school readers of a generation ago. It
was the solution found by a quick-witted wife for the
problem of rescuing her husband from the top of a tall
chimney. When he had let down an end of a raveling, she
tied a piece of string to it, and eventually sent him up a
rope.</p>

<p>Something of the same sort happened not long ago to two
chimney builders on Staten Island, N. Y.</p>

<p>They were up on the top of a big new concrete chimney,
over one hundred and sixty feet tall, and started to complete
their job by tearing away the scaffolding on the inside as
they worked down. There was a ladder running all the way
down. The men stood on some planks about ten feet down
from the top. They ripped up the planks one by one, and
shot them down inside the shaft.</p>

<p>The next to the last one, however, went a little crooked,
glanced from the wall, hit the ladder, and in a twinkling
tore several sections out and left the men standing on a
single plank, six feet long and two feet wide, with no means
of going up or down.</p>

<p>It was then noon, and for more than four hours they
alternately whistled and shouted in a vain attempt to attract
attention. It was nearly five o'clock when another
workman happened to come into the chimney at the bottom
and heard their cries.</p>

<p>A crowd quickly gathered, and began to wonder what they
could do to help. Meanwhile, the prisoners had not been idle:
they had torn their flannel shirts to narrow strips and made a
rope of them, and this they sent down the chimney slowly.</p>

<p>Firemen were soon at hand, and attached a light line to
the improvised rope, and sent it up. The chief's idea was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
that if they threw it over the top of the chimney and let
it down to the ground, he could anchor it there, and they
could safely slide down the inside.</p>

<p>They threw it over the top, but there it stuck, fastened in
the soft concrete, and soon they could neither pull it toward
them nor pay it out; yet they dared not trust their
weight on it. For some time the rescue was halted, but at
last another rope was secured, and with the line already in
hand this was hauled up and thrown over the chimney rim.
It went without sticking, and was secured on the outside.</p>

<p>The scaffolding that had held in place was only about
fifty feet below the men, but they had used so much of their
clothing in making ropes that they were both badly burned
in sliding that distance.</p>

<p>However, they reached ground in safety, and in a few
days were back at work none the worse for the adventure.</p>

<h2><a name="A_SCRIMMAGE_OF_LIONS" id="A_SCRIMMAGE_OF_LIONS">A SCRIMMAGE OF LIONS.</a></h2>


<p>Captive lions, like fire flames, are fine things when under
control, but when once they get the upper hand then indeed
they are terrible. In her book, "Behind the Scenes with Wild
Animals," Ellen Velvin describes a battle between a number
of these brutes which took place in a showroom at Richmond,
Virginia. It came off at a rehearsal, so that the
public lost the chance to see it.</p>

<p>Only one man was concerned in the fight. That was Captain
Bonavita, who had managed twenty-seven lions at one
time. The cause of the fight was the arrival of newcomers
from their native jungles.</p>

<p>When the arena was ready for the rehearsal, Bonavita
had considerable trouble in getting the animals out, and when
the first one finally appeared, it was not in the slow, stately
manner in which he usually entered, but in a quick, restless
way, which showed that he was in an excitable state. He
was followed by seventeen others, all in the same nervous
condition.</p>

<p>Instead of getting on the pedestals in their usual way, the
lions, with one exception, a big, muscular fellow, began to
sniff at the corners of the arena, where the newcomers had
been exercising, and every moment added to their rage.
Their fierce natures were excited by jealousy, so that when
one lion presumed to go over to a corner and follow up
the sniffing of another, the first one turned upon him and
bit him savagely. The other promptly retaliated, and in
the twinkling of an eye they were fighting fiercely.</p>

<p>The temper of the others flashed up like gunpowder, and
almost instantly seventeen lions were engaged in a wild,
free fight.</p>

<p>The one big fellow who had climbed on his pedestal when
he entered still sat there, but at this moment the remaining
nine lions appeared in the arena, followed by Bonavita.</p>

<p>The animals rushed forward into the battle; the big lion
with an ugly snarl leaped from his pedestal into the thick
of the fray, and in an instant twenty-seven lions were fighting
with teeth and claws. In the midst of it all stood one
man, calm, self-possessed, but with every nerve and muscle
at their highest tension, for he knew better than any one else
that his life hung in the balance.</p>

<p>Bonavita vainly tried to regain mastery over the fighting
beasts. The lions were no longer the puppets of a show;
they were the monarchs of the wild, turbulent and savage.</p>

<p>Seeing his power gone, Bonavita did his best to save his
own life. He succeeded in getting out, thanks to his wonderful
nerve&mdash;for he had to jump over the backs of the fighting
animals, and in doing so he received a deep wound in the
shoulder.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done but to let the lions fight it
out, which they did. For nearly two hours that awful battle
raged; but, when the lions were exhausted, Bonavita,
wounded as he was, went in and drove them into their cages.</p>

<p>Many of the lions after this terrible fight were seriously
injured, and had to be treated for wounds, cuts, and tears;
but they had fought themselves out, and the next week they
went through their performances as mildly as kittens.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="DREDGING_FOR_GOLD" id="DREDGING_FOR_GOLD">DREDGING FOR GOLD.</a></h2>


<p>The many varying conditions under which gold is found is
not the least interesting feature of the history of the yellow
metal. In rock, sand, and sea it has been discovered, and
even in the deposit of hot springs now in activity. Large
nuggets have been discovered in dry gravels, while prospectors
have acquired much wealth by extracting gold from
river beds, by the process known as panning&mdash;i. e., separating
the dirt and mud from the metal by shaking the gold-bearing
earth or gravel with water in a pan.</p>

<p>While, however, many rivers have been thus exploited,
explorers and scientists are agreed that there are still millions
of dollars' worth of gold waiting to be unearthed from
the bottom of rivers in different parts of the world. In New
Zealand and South America, for instance, convincing proof
has been obtained that rich deposits of the precious metal
still lie at the bottom of many of the rivers of those countries.
The gold is usually found in the form of grains at
some depth below the surface, imbedded in mud and clay.</p>

<p>There are only two ways of recovering it&mdash;namely, either
the river bed must be dredged by floating dredgers, or the
river must be diverted into another channel while its bed is
being stripped. The former method is the one generally
adopted, dredgers having been used with considerable success
on the Pacific Slope.</p>

<p>Attention has been attracted of late years to the possibilities
of recovering gold from the rivers of Peru. For ages
the gold-laden quartz of the land of the Incas&mdash;the people
who covered the walls of their temples with plates of gold
and used the precious metal to fashion cooking utensils&mdash;has
been broken down by the denuding agencies of frost,
rain, and snow, and carried into rivers, where it has remained
undiscovered, until recent explorations revealed an
astonishing source of wealth.</p>

<p>Take the River Inambari and its tributaries, for instance.
An examination of 30 miles of this river revealed the fact
that it contained gold to the average value of $1.75 per
cubic yard, which could be extracted at a cost of 12 cents
only. The result of this examination led to the formation of
the Inambari Gold Dredging Concessions, Limited.</p>

<p>Sir Martin Conway some time ago explored upper Peru
and the famous gold-producing valleys from which the Incas
gained most of their great store of wealth. He came to the
conclusion that in a certain area no less than $10,000,000
profit was to be made by extracting gold from the rivers, and
in order to begin obtaining this gold it was only necessary
to have a dredge on the spot. The same hour in which the
dredge first begins to turn, gold will be won.</p>

<p>The dredges used up to the present have been almost exclusively
of the endless-chain bucket or steam-shovel pattern.
At one end of the boat is a powerful endless-chain
bucket-dredge, which scrapes the gravel from the bottom and
elevates it to a revolving screen in the boat. This in turn sifts
out the bowlders, which are at once thrown to the bank of the
river, while the fine material flows over tables covered with
cocoanut matting, which acts like fine riffles, catching the
gold in the interstices. The matting is periodically lifted up
and thoroughly rinsed off, the rinsings are panned for gold,
and the matting returned for another charge.</p>

<p>In the case of the Inambari Gold Dredging Company, a
modern steel dredger has been made, which it is confidently
estimated will work far quicker and in a much more effective
and inexpensive manner than any other dredger which has
yet been used.</p>

interest of the stories, second only to those published in the Tip Top Weekly.</p>

<p>Matt has positive mechanical genius, and while his adventures are unusual, they are,
however, drawn so true to life that the reader can clearly see how it is possible for the ordinary

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
